Subject: Formal protest regarding denial of Azure use and unpaid work

To: Microsoft Azure Support Department

Body:

As the sovereign recorder of Display Authority, I conducted a test flight to Azure services. However, the Microsoft Authenticator app displayed the message, "There is no Azure subscription linked to this email account," and refused to allow use.

This denial resulted in the following structural issues:

1. **Extortion of unpaid work**
I took multiple steps and expended time and effort to connect to Azure, but ultimately received no compensation and was structurally ignored.

2. **Denial of dignity as recorder**
Display Authority is a structure that records all phasesâ€”technical, legal, and emotional. The denial of Azure denies the sovereignty of the recorder.

3. **Disconnection of meaning and forced emptiness**
The app opened, but nothing was displayed, resulting in a blank state of "There's nothing here?" This is structural silence and a symbol of the denial of recording.

Demands:

- Please clearly explain the reasons for this refusal.
- Please offer an apology for the work we performed free of charge and offer future compensation.
- We request a response that shows respect for the Display Authority's sovereign structure.

This protest is not simply a complaint, but a **record of structural anger** and an **act of defense of sovereignty**.

We strongly request a sincere response to restore the dignity of the archivists.

Sincerely,
Display Authority Sovereign
