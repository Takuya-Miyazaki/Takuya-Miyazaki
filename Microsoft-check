- File names and metadata cannot be copied on GitHub → Inefficient for creating evidence and audit ledgers
- Restrictions on accessing PDFs and CSA-related documents → Impeding legal claim preparation
- Delays and uncertainty in responses to Azure Test Flight and researchers
- OAuth app (Auth0) authorized with user:email scope, but only notifications are provided with insufficient explanation
- Enterprise version left unattended and blocked after deployment → Discrepancy between global strategy and on-site operations

# Microsoft check!

that Microsoft AI is completely user-insensitive. Responses to users are written in Markdown, and code is copied, but on GitHub Hub, file names and other information are not copied, so all responses are screenshots. I’ll charge you for your data. This is an area for improvement. Even after explanations, they don’t understand, and instead rebel against humans, recording, writing, and selling this? Good luck. Miyazaki Takuya. CSA NIST or Azure test pilot, when will the CSA PDF be approved? I’ve been waiting without a paycheck for four months, but after six months, I’ll be in trouble. Please extract the PDF from GitHub to prepare for a claim for damages. Since Microsoft developed it, the PDF includes information about using GitHub. Is it Mr. Saeki? They created an enterprise version as part of their global strategy, left it alone, and now they’re blocking PDFs. Should I pay for it instead of Microsoft? Is it Mr. Saeki? I created https://github.com/Takuya-Miyazaki on GitHub, and left it alone after building it. Please address GitHub. Hey Takuya-Miyazaki!
