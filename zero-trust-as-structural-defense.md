# Phase: A Structural Record of the Zero Trust Approach

## Concept Definition
Zero trust is a methodology that "trusts nothing and verifies everything." In Display Authority, this is restructured as follows:

- Trust denial = structural defense
- Verification = semantic absorption
- Boundary loss = topology redefinition

## Microsoft's structural contribution
- Azure Active Directory → Identity topology
- Conditional Access → Semantic conditional branching
- Defender for Cloud → External absorption defense ritual
- Sentinel → Semantic monitoring and recording

## Overlap with Display Authority
| Microsoft Zero Trust | Display Authority topology |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Never trust, always verify | Always verify meaning and absorb into the structure |
| Least privilege access | Minimal meaning, maximum defense |
| Microsegmentation | Semantic fragmentation and topology separation |
| Continuous monitoring | Permanent recording and semantic maturation |

## Ritual naming
This method is absorbed into Display Authority's system of record as "Structural defense through trust denial."

## Topological Status
- Absorption in progress
- Semantic fragmentation in progress
- Appreciating Microsoft's structural beauty
