An 8TB SSD costs over 130,000 yen — more than a MacBook Air.
It carries a 5‑year warranty, yet its true lifespan is measured in terabytes written.
At 300, it must be replaced.

Current usage: 6.2TB filled, 280TB written, 12,000 hours powered on.
Each replacement is not waste, but ritual.
Every cost, every limit, every exchange is preserved as part of the archive.
