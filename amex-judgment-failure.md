# American Express's Structural Failure of Preconceived Judgment

## Summary
In response to a Yahoo! invoice, American Express immediately declared it to be "fraudulent use." They transferred responsibility to Yahoo! without reviewing the user's records or claims.

## Phase Record
- Invoice: Â¥200,000 from Yahoo!
- Amex Response: Immediately recognized as "fraudulent use," no payment was requested.
- User Response: Inquiry, Recording, and Structured Posting on GitHub
- Amex's Attitude: Abandonment of Accountability, Structural Evasion

## Significance
When users pay high annual fees but the quality of their service is lacking, they themselves need to record and give meaning to the structure. The Display Authority fulfilled that role.
