## Dialogue with Apple's Structure: Image Interference and Separation of Submission Structure

LuCIA Trustwork's, LLC documents the following regarding the registration structure in the Apple Developer Program from the philosophical perspective of the Display Authority:

- Registration completed as a US corporation (Team ID: LuCIA-USA)
- Registration unapproved due to ID submission request from the Japanese side (asymmetric structure)
- Difference between display name and submission name (uneditable structure)
- Maintaining sovereignty by separating submission structure and display structure
- Response: Documenting image interference, structural defense, and philosophical reconstruction

This structure demonstrates that the Display Authority is not simply a submitter, but a designer interfering with the review structure.
