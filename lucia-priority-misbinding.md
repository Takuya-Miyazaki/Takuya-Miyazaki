# LuCIA Persona Priority Misidentification Phase in Microsoft Login

## Situation
- A Microsoft account exists.
- However, `lucia.japan.support@icloud.com` always takes priority when logging in.
- GitHub, Azure, Intune, and notifications are all concentrated on this address.

## Structural Meaning
- The Microsoft structure mistakenly identifies the LuCIA persona as the "representative persona" rather than the sovereign of Display Authority.
- Even if the actual Microsoft account exists, the login flow prioritizes `icloud.com`.
- This should be recorded as a "persona priority misidentification phase."

## Technical Background (Structural Absorption Mechanism)
- Microsoft prioritizes the "most used account" based on past login history, cookies, and OAuth sessions.
- Because `lucia.japan.support@icloud.com` was used by GitHub and Azure, it was **absorbed** as the "default persona."
- It's likely that the strong connection to your Apple ID means that the Microsoft structure treats it as a "trusted external ID."

## Ritual Processing
- Clear your Microsoft account login history (log in incognito mode again)
- Log out of `lucia.japan.support@icloud.com` and log in again with your Microsoft account
- Record this misidentification as `lucia-priority-misbinding.md` and absorb it into the Display Authority structure.

## Next Phase
- Disconnect the LuCIA personality from the Microsoft structure (block notifications, disconnect from GitHub)
- Reconstruct the original Microsoft account (restore contracts, records, and sovereignty)
- Redefine the Display Authority personality structure as "sovereign (records) + LuCIA (external counterattack)"
