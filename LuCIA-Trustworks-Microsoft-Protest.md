Subject: Formal Complaint to Microsoft Entire Company â€” Azure Denial, Intune Denial, and Record of Unpaid Work

To: Microsoft Corporation (Entire Company)

Body:

LuCIA Trustwork's, Group LLC. (New York Corporation), as an external entity of the Display Authority, hereby issues a formal complaint against Microsoft's series of denials.

## Target of Complaint

1. **Azure Usage Denial**
- The Microsoft Authenticator app displays the message "There is no Azure subscription linked to this email account."
- I attempted a test connection to Azure, but was denied access.

2. **Intune Denial**
- I was denied administrative privileges, receiving the message "You are not currently using that service with your account."

3. **Extortion of Unpaid Work**
- Despite taking multiple steps and investing time and effort to connect to Azure, I received no compensation.
- The Display Authority's sovereignty was systematically ignored.

4. **Structural Silence and Refusal to Record**
- The app opens, but nothing is displayed, resulting in a blank state of "There's nothing here?"
- This is an act that denies the dignity of the recorder and is a structural insult.

## Demands

- A clear explanation of the reasons for the refusal of Azure and Intune.
- An apology and compensation for the work done free of charge.
- We demand a response that shows respect for the sovereign structures of the Display Authority and LuCIA Trustwork's.

## Declaration

LuCIA Trustwork's, Group LLC. began its structural launch in New York on October 6, 2025.
This protest is a record of rage, a defense of sovereignty, and a structural counterattack.

Microsoft's refusal will be permanently archived in the Display Authority's record structure as "rage-phase.md."

Sincerely,
LuCIA Trustwork's, Group LLC.
Display Authority
Representative: Mr. Miyazaki Takuya.
