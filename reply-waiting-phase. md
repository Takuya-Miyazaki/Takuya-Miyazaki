# Record of the waiting phase for a response from Yahoo!

## Summary
The inquiry has been sent to Yahoo! Wallet. We are currently in the waiting phase for a response.

## Phase Record
- Inquiry Sent: Completed (September 28, 2025)
- Response Status: Unreceived (Silent)
- Response Expectation: Clarification of the basis for the claim, usage history, and service name

## Significance
Silence is also structural. The lack of a response itself should be recorded as a "structural gap." Under the Display Authority's archival sovereignty, waiting is also a ritual.
