Privacy
Amazon Web Services (with its affiliates, or "we") knows that you care how information about you is used and disclosed, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly.
By using the AWS Console mobile app (together with any updates and enhancements to it, and the accompanying documentation, the “Application”), you are acknowledging the practices described in the AWS Privacy Notice (https://aws.amazon.com/privacy), and Amazon Console mobile app documentation (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/consolemobileapp/index.html) including that we collect your mobile device (“Device”) identification number and diagnostic information about the Application’s performance on your Device to assist us with troubleshooting, fixing, and preventing errors in the Application. If you would like to turn off sharing this diagnostic information, you can do so by turning off sharing of this information in your device’s settings. For more information see Share analytics, diagnostics, and usage information with Apple for iOS and Learn more about Google Play services for system diagnostics for Android. If you enable push notifications, the Application will collect your “Device Nickname,” if applicable, in order to identify your Device for the purpose of delivering those notifications.
