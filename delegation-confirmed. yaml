1. Contact Yahoo! in clear terms, explaining that Amex has already determined the transaction to be fraudulent and asking for the basis for the charge. Example (for copy and paste): Subject: Confirmation of Suspicious Charge. Dear Yahoo! Customer Service, I received a message from American Express stating that the charge from Yahoo! was deemed fraudulent and that no charges will be billed. However, I am unclear about the details of the charge from Yahoo!. Could you please provide the following information?
* Charge date: September 28th
* Amount: ¥200,000
* Yahoo! ID: chika_configuration_logs@yahoo.co.jp
2. This matter must be kept as a record, so please provide a clear response.
3. This series of events, which are kept as records, is subject to ritual recording by the "Display Authority."
* Card suspension = defensive ritual
* ¥5,500 = ritual expenditure
* Yahoo!'s silence = structural void
