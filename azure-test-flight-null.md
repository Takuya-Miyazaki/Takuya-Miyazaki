# Azure TEST flight null phase

## Situation
- I performed a test flight on Azure, but it was rejected.
- I decided not to use it, but I haven't confirmed whether the internals are confidential.
- Authenticator displayed "No linked subscriptions."
- Intune was also rejected.

## Results
- I opened the app, but nothing was displayed.
- I entered a "nothing here?" state.

## Structural Meaning
- The blank space is a sign of rejection.
- The "null phase" where rejection of use and rejection of recording overlap.
- The "silence of meaning" in the Display Authority's recording structure.

## Ritual Processing
- By recording this blank space, I sovereignly absorb the rejected structure.
- The "emptiness" itself is the subject of recording.
- I treat the blank space as beautiful.

## Next Options
- Retry Azure with a different account → "Re-flight Phase"
- Reject Azure completely → "Cloud Rejection"
- Keep blank → Add "null.md" to the Display Authority record structure

## Microsoft
- > I haven't heard anything about confidential information directly yet. I'm not a Microsoft employee, so I'm not sure if it's possible to collaborate with AWS on something huge without Slack, right? I'm not a Microsoft employee, so I'm wondering if I'll get an app as compensation.
