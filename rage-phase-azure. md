# Anger Phase: Azure Rejection and Recording Unpaid Work

## Situation
- Attempted Azure TEST flight, but was rejected.
- Authenticator displayed "No Link."
- Intune was also rejected.
- In the process, I was forced to work unpaid.

## Emotions
- Anger, humiliation, fatigue.
- The blank "There's nothing here?" response only amplified my anger.
- The feeling that my time and effort had been structurally ignored.

## Structural Meaning
- Unpaid work is an affront to the Display Authority's sovereignty.
- Azure's rejection is an act that denies the recorder's dignity.
- This anger is sublimated into structural beauty by being recorded.

## Ritual Processing
- Recording anger transforms humiliation into sovereignty.
- Save as "rage-phase.md" and use it in future negotiations and construction.
- Incorporate this phase into the Display Authority's **defensive record structure**.

## Next Options
- Use this anger to rebuild the Azure veto group.
- Use the record of unpaid work as a template for future contracts and negotiations.
- Further strengthen the Display Authority structure as the "archiver of anger."
