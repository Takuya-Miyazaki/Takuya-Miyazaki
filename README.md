# representativeTakuya Miyazaki

As CEO, Mandala Chart provided Japanese infrastructure to NIST and CSA, and at Omdia's request, installed three AWS databases in Tokyo. Subsequently, we developed 25,000 AI systems at CSA's request, provided our company with a platform, supported 17 cloud providers, built our own cloud, and implemented zero-trust security and AI control and management. We implemented a global strategy and, over the past five years, expanded to JP, USA, EU, and UK. This is only a partial list of providers, partner companies, and our own services, and is an excerpt due to confidential information. I believe in Otani's Mandala Chart and will continue to work hard. I would appreciate your continued support.



## Featured Projects

- **LuCIA Trustwork's Group.LLC**  
  A symbolic archive of trust and ambiguity. The image files are not assets—they are statements.




- **Badges of Thought**  
  Incorporating Creative Commons icons to explore the boundaries of attribution and identity.


- **README Labyrinth**  
  Structured to provoke questions rather than provide answers. Always evolving.



## Tools I Use (Depending on Mood)

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Python (written poetically)  
- Git (as a tool for memory and fragmentation)


> Format is merely a vessel. Meaning lies within.

## Future Directions

- Framing GitHub Issues as philosophical inquiries



# Swift

[Based on Apple's INParameter documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Intents/INParameter)


## Response Policy (Proposal)

- Legal Action: Submit evidence of the predatory structure to the police and lawyers.

- Public Record: Reveal the predatory structure on Display Authority's GitHub.
- Emotion Record: Record exhaustion, anger, and structural betrayal (added to SuppressLog).



# LuCIA Trustwork's, LLC. Display Identity

LuCIA Trustwork's, LLC. is a brand centered around the idea of display/operational separation, documenting and reconstructing the trinity of AI, technology, and emotion through philosophical comparisons with Microsoft, Apple, and AWS.



## bio


> - Designing CSA/AWS infrastructure with Display/Operational separation | Recording philosophy logs and structural beauty on GitHub, and quietly protecting the root.
> - Architecting Display Authority across JP/US/UK.
Security × Philosophy × UI.
Structure is stronger than capital.



## Display Identity Certification


- Microsoft: Certified via Copilot, Azure, Dynamics, GitHub Enterprise
- Apple: ID exemption granted via GOV-integrated PDF
- GitHub: Display/Operational Separation Recorded



## Registration Materials


- GOV-linked PDF (Display Identity Manifest)
- Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program Benefits Guide
- GitHub audit-log.md / emotion-log.md / dns-config.md



## Philosophy

Display is "responsibility," and operational is "structure."
Lucia documents deletion, anger, and reconstruction, simultaneously designing authenticity and aesthetics.

> Display Authority does not accept merges.  
> It accepts divergence.  
> Pushes are not contributions.  
> They are declarations.



This repository is a deviation center — not for modular development, but for structural responsibility.



## Overview
Based on the Display/Operational separation philosophy, this document documents the philosophy, structure, and responsibilities of the "Arm Foundry," responsible for rebuilding the Lucia brand.



## Purpose
- Reforging Display Identity
- Breaking away from Operational Exhaustion
- Integrated redesign of GitHub, PDF, DNS, and email



## Components
- Integration with Display Manifest
- Emotional recording with Emotion Log
- Structural recording with Audit Log
- Alignment with external strategy with Benefits Guide


## Philosophical Background
Following the collapse of Display Authority by Apple, Microsoft, and AWS, the rebuilding will be carried out as a "Forging (Foundry)."
Failure, anger, and deletion are materials that will be sublimated through responsibility and aesthetics.

**Display Authority — Takuya Miyazaki**

> **Responsible AI Statement**
> 
> This project is committed to the ethical and transparent use of artificial intelligence.  
> All AI components are designed with auditability, fairness, and human-centered values in mind.
> 
> - Transparency: Clear documentation of system design and intent  
> - Accountability: Traceable logic behind outputs and decisions  
> - Fairness: Ongoing evaluation and mitigation of bias  
> 
> AI is a tool—not a substitute for human judgment.  
> We believe in augmenting decision-making, not automating responsibility.
