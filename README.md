### Responsible AI 

# arm-foundry.md

## Overview
Based on the Display/Operational separation philosophy, this document documents the philosophy, structure, and responsibilities of the "Arm Foundry," responsible for rebuilding the Lucia brand.

## Purpose
- Reforging Display Identity
- Breaking away from Operational Exhaustion
- Integrated redesign of GitHub, PDF, DNS, and email

## Components
- Integration with Display Manifest
- Emotional recording with Emotion Log
- Structural recording with Audit Log
- Alignment with external strategy with Benefits Guide

## Philosophical Background
Following the collapse of Display Authority by Apple, Microsoft, and AWS, the rebuilding will be carried out as a "Forging (Foundry)."
Failure, anger, and deletion are materials that will be sublimated through responsibility and aesthetics.

## Implementation Manager
Takuya Miyazaki
Display Designer, AI Development Manager, Brand Philosopher

> AI is a tool—not a substitute for human judgment.  
> We believe in augmenting decision-making, not automating responsibility.
