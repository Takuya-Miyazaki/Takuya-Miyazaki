# Lucia Modular Identity Framework


## Philosophy
Lucia represents light, clarity, and trust woven into modular infrastructure.  
This framework separates display-only identity from operational sovereignty.

## Domains

| Layer | Domain | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Display | `lucia.group` | Public-facing brand, philosophy, and profile  
| Operational | `infra.lucia.systems` | CLI, API, DNS, and AI orchestration  
| Audit | `audit.lucia.one` | Contracts, equity structure, and transparency logs  

## DNS Strategy
All domains are managed via Cloudflare.  
Subdomains are modular and reversible.

## Infrastructure
- Hosting: GitHub Pages (display), Azure/GCP (ops)
- Security: CrowdStrike Falcon (ops layer)
- Email: Google Workspace (via MX records)

## Licensing
All content and code are governed by modular licensing agreements.  
See `audit.lucia.one/license.md` for details.

## Identity

@Lucia.microsoft.com  
Operational alias used during corporate registration phase.  
Official entity name pending legal confirmation.  
All communications routed via Microsoft infrastructure for auditability and consistency.

Strategic operator and systems architect focused on transparency, auditability, and operational sovereignty.  
Specializing in multi-vendor alignment across Microsoft, GitHub, Apple, and Omdia.

Currently developing a Zero Trust–based AI monitoring and management system in Tokyo.  
The architecture emphasizes operational sovereignty, real-time anomaly detection, and scalable security across distributed environments.

This initiative explores:
- Trustless infrastructure for sensitive AI workflows
- CLI/API-based validation and audit trails
- Strategic concealment vs. transparent observability

If you're working on AI that watches the watchers, we might already be aligned.
---

## Areas of Focus

- Business registration and infrastructure orchestration
- CLI-based validation logic for operational resilience
- Responsible AI design aligned with NIST frameworks
- Provisional vs official data management strategies

---

## Key Repositories

| Repository | Description | Tech Stack |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| `cvss-v4-calculator` | CVSS v4.0 scoring tool | JavaScript |
| `SecurityBenchmarks` | Azure security benchmark templates | Markdown / YAML |
| `securitylab` | GitHub Security Lab integrations | C / Markdown |

## Philosophy

> "Responsible AI should elevate human dignity and create new employment — not just efficiency."

---

## Contact

- Based in Tokyo
- Operational email addresses are CLI-validated; display-only addresses are not recommended

### Responsible AI 



> **Responsible AI Statement**
> 
> This project is committed to the ethical and transparent use of artificial intelligence.  
> All AI components are designed with auditability, fairness, and human-centered values in mind.
> 
> - Transparency: Clear documentation of system design and intent  
> - Accountability: Traceable logic behind outputs and decisions  
> - Fairness: Ongoing evaluation and mitigation of bias  
> 
> AI is a tool—not a substitute for human judgment.  
> We believe in augmenting decision-making, not automating responsibility.
