Last Update: December 10, 2024
Docker, Inc. (“Docker”) is committed to protecting the privacy of your information. We provide this Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information and/or personal data received from users of our websites (“Website”), services, applications, or software (“Services”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to data that we receive through other means, including offline and as part of employment relationships. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason, at our sole discretion. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on our Website. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. By using or accessing the Docker Services, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy, and you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or our use of your personally identifiable information, please contact us using this form https://preferences.docker.com/privacy/.
1. Services Use and Information Collected
Docker collects information from individuals who visit the Website (“Visitors”) and individuals who register to use the Services (“Customers”) either individually or on behalf of an entity. Docker may also collect information about how you use the Services, such as activity data, feature usage and product version data. This information may be aggregated or identifiable as further described in this Privacy Policy. Docker may collect data to improve our operations and to understand how to provide you with the best experience.
When registering to use or expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about the Services or registering to use the Services, Docker may require you to provide us with personal contact information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, and email address (“Required Contact Information”). When purchasing the Services, Docker may require you to provide us with financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, partial credit card number, and the number of employees within the organization that will be using the Services (“Billing Information”). Docker may also ask you to provide additional information, such as company annual revenues, number of employees, or industry (“Optional Information”). Required Contact Information, Billing Information, and Optional Information are referred to collectively as “Data About Docker Customers.” As you navigate the Website, Docker may also collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons (“Website Navigational Information”). Website Navigational Information includes standard information from your Web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the actions you take on the Website (such as the Web pages viewed and the links clicked). By choosing to provide any information to Docker, you are giving Docker permission to use and store such information consistent with this Privacy Policy.
2. Use of Information Collected
Docker uses Data About Docker Customers to perform the services requested. Docker may also use Data About Docker Customers for marketing purposes. For example, Docker may use information you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in the Services and to send you information regarding Docker and its partners, such as information about promotions or events. Docker uses credit card information you provide for payment, solely to check the financial qualifications of prospective Customers and to collect payment for the Services. Docker uses Website Navigational Information to operate and improve the Website. Docker may also use Website Navigational Information alone or in combination with Data About Docker Customers to provide personalized information about Docker.
3. Docker Website, Cookies and Navigation Information
3.1 Website and Navigation Information
Docker may use commonly used information gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information as you navigate the Website (“Website Navigational Information”). This section describes the types of Website Navigational Information that may be collected on the Website and how this information may be used.
3.1(a) Cookies – Docker may use cookies to make interactions with the Website easy and meaningful. When you visit the Website, Docker’s servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you. They merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Docker, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form, you remain anonymous to Docker. Docker uses cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer. If you have chosen to identify yourself to Docker, Docker uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow Docker to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into the Services, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed on your browser. These session cookies allow Docker to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Services and to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies are required to use the Services. Docker may use persistent cookies that only Docker can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the Website. When you purchase the Services or provide Docker with personal information, a unique identifier is assigned to you. This unique identifier is associated with a persistent cookie that Docker places on your Web browser. Docker is especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, Docker does not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. If you disable your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Website, but you will not be able to successfully use the Services. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site. Docker may use information from session and persistent cookies in combination with Data About Docker Customers to provide you with information about Docker and the Services.
3.1(b) Web Beacons – Docker may use Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Visitors’ usage of the Website and interaction with emails from Docker. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Website tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a Website tied to the Web beacon. For example, Docker may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify Docker when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of the Websites. Docker uses Web beacons to operate and improve the Website and email communications including for marketing purposes. Docker may use information from Web beacons in combination with Data About Docker Customers to provide you with information about Docker and the Services.
3.1(c) Flash Cookies – Docker may use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit. Third parties, with whom Docker partners to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.
3.1(d) IP Addresses – When you visit the Website, Docker may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information. For example, Docker may use IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Visitors navigate the Website.
3.1(e) Third Party Cookies – From time to time, Docker may engage third parties to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from individuals who visit the Website. Docker may also use other third-party cookies to track the performance of Docker advertisements. The information provided to third parties does not include personal information, but this information may be re-associated with personal information after Docker receives it. Docker may also contract with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other Website Navigational Information on the Website and emails and on third-party websites. Ad networks follow your online activities over time by collecting Website Navigational Information through automated means, including through the use of cookies. They use this information to provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests. You may see these advertisements on other Websites. This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
4. Public Forums, Refer a Friend, and Customer Testimonials
Docker may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on the Website. Any personal information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. Docker is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums. Customers and Visitors may elect to use Docker’s referral program to inform friends about the Website. When using the referral program, Docker requests the friend’s name and email address. Docker will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Website. Docker does not store this information. Docker may post a list of Customers and testimonials on the Website that contain information such as Customer names and titles. Docker obtains the consent of each Customer prior to posting any information on such a list or posting testimonials.
5. Third party providers
We use third party providers such as Google Analytics and others to help us provide the Services. In order to gain useful insights these analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of the Services and across other websites and online services.
6. Sharing of Information Collected
Docker may share Data About Docker Customers with Docker’s service providers so that these service providers can contact Customers and Visitors who have provided contact information on our behalf. Docker may also share Data About Docker Customers with Docker’s service providers to ensure the quality of information provided. Docker also provides information on how particular domains (e.g., www.companyx.com ) access and use our Website, Services, and particular features or uploads to customers for their business purposes, for example, so they can improve or target their software and other offerings. From time to time, Docker may partner with other companies to jointly offer products or services. If you purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly-offered product or service from Docker, Docker may share Data About Docker Customers collected in connection with your purchase or expression of interest with our joint promotion partner(s), once Docker has notified you of the information to be shared and obtained your consent to the sharing of the information. Docker does not control our business partners’ use of the Data About Docker Customers we collect, and their use of the information will be in accordance with their own privacy policies. Docker may use third-party service providers to manage credit card processing. Neither Docker nor such service providers will be permitted to store, retain, or use Billing Information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on Docker’s behalf. Docker reserves the right to use or disclose information provided if required by law or if Docker reasonably believes that use or disclosure is necessary to protect Docker’s rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
Under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, Docker is responsible for the processing of personal data received from Customers from the EU, the UK, and Switzerland and onward transfers to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. We comply with the Data Privacy Framework Principles for such onward transfers and remain liable in accordance with the Data Privacy Framework Principles if third-party agents that we engage to process such information about you on our behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Data Privacy Framework Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
7. Users from outside the United States
Docker and its Services are based in the U.S., and Docker’s offices are headquartered in the U.S. Please be aware that information you provide to Docker that it obtains as a result of your use of the Services may be processed and transferred to the U.S. and be subject to U.S. law. This information may also be processed by staff working for Docker or for one of its suppliers in the U.S. By using the Website, participating in any of the Services, or by providing Docker with your information, you consent to this collection, transfer, storage, and processing of information to and in the U.S. Docker will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely in accordance with this privacy policy.
8. Supplemental Privacy Notices for the EEA, California and other States
Depending on your country, region or state of residence the Supplemental Privacy Notices A through C of this Privacy Policy may also apply to you.
