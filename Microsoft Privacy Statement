Personal Information We Collect
	
Microsoft collects data from your interactions with or through our products for a variety of purposes, including to improve the efficiency of our services and to optimize your experience on our products, as described below. Some of the data we collect is data provided to us directly by users. For example, when you create a Microsoft account, manage your organization's license account, send a search query to Bing, register for a Microsoft event, upload a document to OneDrive, sign up for Microsoft 365, contact support, and so on. Some of this data is collected by us about your interaction, use, and experience of our products and your communication with us. In addition, Microsoft receives data from Microsoft's affiliates, subsidiaries, and third parties.
	
We process data on various legal grounds and permissions (also known as "legal bases"), such as your consent, the need to maintain legitimate interests, the need to enter into and perform a contract, compliance with a legal obligation, and the various purposes listed below.
	
In addition, data is provided by third parties. Data obtained from third parties is protected in accordance with the policies described in this Statement and the additional restrictions set forth in the data acquisition destination. Third-party data sources can change, but here are some examples:
		
•	Data brokers for demographic data that Microsoft purchases to supplement the data it collects.
		
•	A service that allows users to create content, such as local business reviews or public social media posts, and make that content available to others.
		
•	Communication services such as email providers and social networks (if you have given us permission to access your data for such third-party services or networks).
		
•	Service providers that help you locate your device.
		
•	Partners who offer services and co-marketing activities under co-branding with Microsoft.
		
•	Developers who create experiences through or Microsoft products.
		
•	Third parties that provide experiences through Microsoft products, such as Cortana-related skills.
		
•	Publicly available sources such as publicly available public sector, academic, commercial data sets, and other data sources.
	
If you are a representative of an organization that uses Microsoft enterprise and developer products, such as businesses and schools, please see the Enterprise and developer products section of this Privacy Statement for information about how we process your data. For end users of Microsoft products or Microsoft accounts provided by your organization, see the Products provided by your organization and the Microsoft account sections for more information.
	
Users can choose which technology to use and what data to share. If you are asked to provide personal data, you can refuse. Many of our products require personal data to perform the service and provide it to users. If the data required for the operation of a product or feature and its provision to the user is not provided, the user cannot use the product or feature. Similarly, if we are required by law to collect personal data or enter into or perform a contract with the user, we cannot enter into a contract if we cannot obtain data from the user. If it is related to your existing product, you may need to stop or cancel your use. If this is the case, the user will be notified at that time. If you choose not to share your personal data if you are voluntary, you will not be able to use features such as personalization settings that use that data.
	
The data collected depends on the context of your interactions with Microsoft, your choices such as privacy settings, the products and features you use, your location, and applicable laws.
	
The data collected may include:
	
Name and contact data. Your name, email address, address, phone number, and other similar contact data.

In addition, if you apply for a promotion of a product, we will collect the data you enter in the application form.
	
Content. The content of files and communications that users enter, upload, receive, create, and control. For example, if you use Teams to send a file to another Teams user, we need to collect the contents of that file in order to display it to the sender and the other user. When you use Outlook.com to receive emails, we need to collect the content of the email to put it in your inbox, display it, make it available for reply, and store it until you delete it. Other content collected when offering products includes:
		
•	Communication, including audio, video, text (keyboard, handwriting, dictation, and other types), messages, emails, calls, meeting requests, and chats.
		
•	Media and documents such as photos, images, music, videos, and software that you have stored, retrieved, or otherwise processed in the cloud.
	
Video or recording. Recording/recording of events and activities in Microsoft buildings, sales spaces, and other locations.

Feedback and evaluation. The content of the information you provide to us or the messages you send, such as feedback you complete, survey data, and product ratings.
	
Traffic data. Data generated by your use of Microsoft's communication services. Traffic data shows you who you communicated with and when. Microsoft only uses traffic data to provide, maintain, and improve our communication services, and we do so with your consent.
	
The following product-specific sections describe the actual data collection that applies to your use of those products.
	
Use of your personal data
	
Microsoft uses the data we collect to provide users with a rich, interactive experience. Specific uses of the data include:
		
•	Offering our products. This includes providing updates, security, troubleshooting, and support. This includes sharing data when a user needs to provide a service or perform a transaction requested by a user.
		
•	Improvement and development of our products.
		
•	Customization and recommendation of our products.
		
•	Advertising and sales to users. This includes promotional communications, targeted advertising, and presenting products or services that are relevant to users.
	
We also use the data to conduct our business. This includes applications such as analyzing performance, adhering to legal obligations, developing employees, and conducting surveys.
	
To do this, we may also combine data collected from different contexts (such as two Microsoft products that you use). For example, the Microsoft Store uses information about the apps and services you use to recommend apps that are right for each user. However, we have incorporated technical and procedural precautions to prevent the combination of certain personal data where required by law. For example, if required by law, data collected when a user is not authenticated (not signed in) is stored separately from account information that can directly identify the user, such as name, email address, and phone number.
	
The processing of personal data for such purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods. Automated methods are often associated with and supported by manual methods. For example, to build, train, and improve the accuracy of automated processing methods (including artificial intelligence or AI), we manually review some of the output generated by automated methods against the underlying data.
	
As part of product improvement and development, we may use your data to develop and train AI models. Learn more here (https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-copilot/learn/?ep=0&form=MA13LV&es=31#faq).
	
Purpose and legal basis of processing
	
Microsoft has changed the details of this section and the "Why do we share personal data" in the Privacy Statement? As described in the section, as necessary to provide you with the products you use, to operate Microsoft's business, to fulfill our contractual and legal obligations, to protect the security and safety of Microsoft's systems and customers, and to fulfill any other legitimate interests of Microsoft or any third party. We process your personal data with your consent. The basis for processing your personal data may vary depending on how we process your data and our products and services. 
	
If we process personal data based on our or a third party's legitimate interests, we will only process your personal data if our legitimate interests in processing do not outweigh your interests, taking into account the balance between those interests and your rights and freedoms.
	
When we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, we do so in accordance with the "Where and process personal information (https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement#mainwherewestoreandprocessdatamodule)" section of this Privacy Statement and are based on various legal mechanisms.
	
The processing of personal data also serves the following purposes:
		
•	Offering our products. We use data to run our products and provide you with rich, interactive experiences. For example, if a user is using OneDrive, documents uploaded by users to OneDrive as part of the service are processed so that users can perform tasks such as retrieving, deleting, editing, and transferring. Also, if you enter a search query into the Bing search engine, for example, it will use that query to display search results. In addition, because communication is built into the functionality of various products, programs and activities, data may be used when contacting users. For example, Microsoft may contact you by phone, email, or other means to notify you when your subscription is about to end or to explain your license account. In addition, we may contact you to protect our products, such as to notify you when product updates are available.
		
•	Product improvements. We use data to continuously improve our products, including adding new features and capabilities. For example, the use of error reporting to improve security features, the use of Bing search queries and clicks to improve the relevance of search results, the use of usage data to prioritize new features, and the use of voice data to improve speech recognition accuracy.
		
•	Personal settings. Many products include personalization features, such as recommendations that expand user productivity and enjoyment. This feature uses an automated process to customize your product experience based on the data we hold about you, such as you, your product usage and activity, your interests, and Microsoft's guesses about your location. For example, depending on your settings, you might want to see recommended apps from the Microsoft Store that are more stream-efficient when streaming movies in a browser on your Windows device. If you're using a Microsoft account, you can also sync settings across multiple devices with your permission. Many of our products provide controls to disable the ability to personalize your preferences.
		
•	Product activation. We use data such as device and application type, location information, and unique device, application, network, and subscription identifiers to activate products that require activation.
		
•	Product development. We use data to develop new products. For example, they often use anonymized data to train and fine-tune AI models that can better understand customers' computing and productivity needs and shape the development of new products. 
		
•	Customer support. Microsoft uses data to troubleshoot and diagnose product issues, repair users' devices, and provide other user care and support services. This includes providing products, services, and training, improving quality, protecting security, and investigating security incidents. You can also use the data from your call recordings to authenticate or identify you based on your voice so that Microsoft can provide support services and investigate security incidents.
		
•	Security protection and troubleshooting. We use data to secure and troubleshoot our products. This includes using data to protect the safety and security of our products and our customers, detect malware and malicious activity, troubleshoot performance and compatibility issues to improve the user experience, and notify users of updates about our products. They may also use automated systems to detect security and safety issues.
		
•	Security. Data is used to protect the safety of our products and users. Our security features and products can stop malicious software from working and notify users when malicious software is found on their devices. For example, our products, such as Outlook.com and OneDrive, systematically and automatically scan content to detect suspected spam, viruses, and fraudulent activity, as well as identify URLs that are flagged as links to scams, phishing, or malware. In addition, if any communication or content violates the terms of the Agreement, we reserve the right to block the transmission of communications or remove the content. Pursuant to European Union Regulation (EU) 2021/1232, Microsoft has invoked the exemptions permitted by the EU Directive 2002/58/EC in Articles 5(1) and 6(1). We use scanning technology to create digital signatures (called "hashes") for specific images and video content on the system. These technologies then compare the generated hashes with the hashes of reported images of child sexual exploitation and abuse (called "hash sets") in a process called "hash matching." Microsoft obtains hash sets from organizations that work in the public interest against child sexual abuse. This allows us to share information with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and law enforcement. We also use tools to detect misuse of video calling features to deter high-risk users from generating or sharing images of child sexual exploitation and abuse. Learn more about our efforts to prevent and detect child exploitation here (https://www.microsoft.com/corporate-responsibility/digital-safety-content-report). 
		
•	Updates。 The data we collect is used to develop product updates and security fixes. For example, we may use information about your device's features, such as available memory, to provide software updates or security fixes. The purpose of updates and fixes is to maximize the user experience with our products, to help protect your privacy and data security, to provide new features, and to evaluate your device's readiness to handle such updates.
		
•	Promotional communications. We use the data we collect to provide you with promotional communications. Users can sign up for email subscriptions and choose how to communicate with Microsoft via email, SMS, mail, and phone. For more information about managing your contact data, email subscriptions, and promotional communications, please see the "How to access and manage your personal data" section of this Privacy Statement.
		
•	related products and services. Microsoft uses data to provide you with relevant and valuable information about our products. By analyzing data from diverse sources, it predicts the most relevant and interesting information for users and provides such information in a variety of ways. For example, if you predict that users will be interested in your game, let them know about new games they are likely to like.
		
•	Advertisement. Microsoft does not use your speech, documents, photos, or personal files in email, person-to-person chat, or video calls for targeted advertising. We use data collected through interactions with you through some first-party products, services, apps, web properties (Microsoft properties), and third-party web properties to serve ads on Microsoft properties and third-party sites. Party properties. Automated processes may also be used to show users ads that are more relevant. For information about how data about you is used for advertising, please refer to the Advertising (https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement#mainadvertisingmodule) section of this Privacy Statement.
		
•	Prize promotions and events. Your data is used to promote prizes offered in physical Microsoft Stores and to conduct events. For example, if you enter a prize promotion, we may use your data for the purpose of selecting winners and presenting prizes to winning customers. And when you register for a coding workshop or gaming event, we add your name to the list of potential attendees.
		
•	Processing of commercial transactions. Data is used to process your transactions with us. For example, we process payment information to provide users with subscriptions to our products and use contact information to deliver products purchased from the Microsoft Store.
		
•	Reporting and business operations. Data is used to analyze operations and perform business intelligence. This allows you to make informed decisions and generate reports on the performance of your operations.
		
•	protection of rights and property; Data is used to detect fraud, resolve disputes, enforce contracts, and protect property. For example, data is used to verify the validity of software licenses and reduce unauthorized copying. We may also use automated processes to detect and avoid behavior that violates our rights and the rights of others, such as fraud.
		
•	Compliance with laws and regulations. Microsoft processes data to comply with applicable laws and regulations. For example, we use your age information so that we can fulfill our obligations to protect your child's privacy. We also process contact information and credentials to help users exercise their data protection rights.
		
•	Research. We use data to conduct research such as advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities, for example, in the public interest and for scientific purposes, using appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the rights and freedoms of individuals.
	
Why do we share personal data?
	
We will share your personal information with your consent or to the extent necessary to complete a transaction or provide you with a product you have requested or certified. For example, if a user requests it, share content information with a third party. For example, you might want to send an email to a friend, share photos or documents in OneDrive, or link your account with another service. When you use Microsoft products from your organization (such as work or school) or use an email address provided by such an organization to access Microsoft products, we share certain data (interaction and diagnostic data) to help your organization administer the product. When you provide payment information for purchases, Microsoft may share payment information with financial institutions that provide payment processing and financial services to prevent fraud and limit credit risk. In addition, if you or another Microsoft account holder stores a payment method (such as a card) in your account that you or another Microsoft account holder uses to make purchases from Microsoft or its affiliates, your purchase receipt may be shared with other users who use the same payment method (including the designated account holder for the payment method) for purchases from Microsoft and have access. If you allow push notifications for Microsoft products or applications on a non-Windows device, that device's operating system processes some personal data to provide push notifications. Therefore, Microsoft may send data to external third-party notification providers to deliver push notifications. Device push notification services are subject to their own service-specific terms of use and privacy statement.
	
We also share personal data for digital advertising purposes. When you visit a website or use an app that displays ads, your digital properties may allow you to access or receive device data or certain other data identified by the personal data collected in the sections above. We may then share this information with third-party advertising platforms and advertisers to facilitate the delivery and measurement of ads on such digital properties. For more information about how data is used for advertising, see the "Advertising and US State Data Privacy" section below.
	
In addition, we share personal information among Microsoft affiliates and subsidiaries. We also share personal information with vendors and agents who perform business on our behalf for the purposes set forth in this Statement. For example, our contractors who provide customer service support or help protect our systems and services may need access to your personal information to perform their jobs. In this case, they must comply with our personal data protection and security requirements. In addition, the personal information we receive from us may not be used for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal data as part of a business-to-business transaction, such as a merger or asset sale.
	
Finally, if we have a good conscience belief that it is necessary to do any of the following, we will access and maintain, disclose, transfer, or store your personal data, including your content (for example Outlook.com, the content of your email or files in a private folder on OneDrive).
		
•	To comply with applicable laws or to respond to due legal process, such as from a judicial or other government agency.
		
•	Protect the safety of users, organizations, and the public. For example, to prevent spam, fraud, or other damaging behavior, and to detect, prevent, and address harmful or illegal activity, including creating or sharing harmful or illegal content.
		
•	To manage and maintain the security of our products, including to prevent or stop attacks on computer systems and networks.
		
•	To protect Microsoft's rights or property, including to enforce terms governing the use of the Services. – However, if we receive information that someone else is using our services to transfer stolen Microsoft intellectual or physical property, we will not examine your personal information, but we will refer it to law enforcement.
	
For more information about the data we disclose at the request of judicial and other government authorities, see the Report on Requests from Law Enforcement (https://www.microsoft.com/about/corporate-responsibility/lerr/)Authorities.
	
Please note that some of our products may contain links to or otherwise make third-party products accessible to third-party products that have different privacy policies than Microsoft's products. If you provide personal data for these products, your data will be subject to that third-party privacy policy.

The above selections do not apply to Required Service Communications that are part of certain Microsoft products, programs, or activities. It also does not apply to surveys or other informational communications with a different unsubscribe method.
	
Ad selection
	
To opt out of receiving personalized advertising (including Xandr) from Microsoft, visit our opt-out (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759)page. If you opt out, your settings will be stored in a cookie unique to your web browser. Opt-out cookies are valid for 5 years. If you delete cookies from your device, you will need to opt out again.
	
You can also link your opt-out choice with your personal Microsoft account. It will then apply to all devices you use with that account, and will continue until you sign in with a different personal Microsoft account on that device. If you delete cookies from your device, you'll need to sign in again to apply your settings. You can find out more about Microsoft's third-party advertising partners (https://learn.microsoft.com/xandr/policies-regulations/third-party-providers) in the U.S. State Data Privacy Law Notice (https://aka.ms/USStatePrivacyNotice), and you can opt out of sharing your data with third parties on the opt-out page (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2214802).
	
For Microsoft-controlled ads that appear in Windows apps, you can opt-out by using the opt-out linked to your personal Microsoft account, or you can opt out of interest-based advertising by turning off the advertising identifier in Windows settings.
	
Because the data used for interest-based advertising is used for other necessary purposes (including product delivery, analytics, and fraud prevention), opting out of interest-based advertising does not stop this data collection. Your ads will still appear, but they may be less relevant to your users.
	
You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from third parties by visiting our partners' sites (see above).
	
Browser-based management
	
If you use a browser, you can use certain features to control your personal data. Example:
		
•	Cookie controls. You can use the browser-based cookie management described in the Cookiessection of this Privacy Statement to control the data stored by cookies and to withdraw your consent to cookies.
		
•	Tracking prevention. You can control the data collected about you on third-party sites using Internet Explorer (version 9 or higher) and Microsoft Edge's tracking protection feature. This feature blocks third-party content, including cookies, on sites that are included in user-added anti-tracking lists.
		
•	Some browsers have built-in Do Not Track (DNT) features, which can signal to websites that they do not want to be tracked. Because there is still no common understanding of how to interpret DNT signals, Microsoft services are not currently responding to browser DNT signals. We are working with other online vendors to define a common understanding of how to handle DNT signals. In this context, you may use other tools we provide to manage data collection and use, such as the ability to opt-out of the delivery of interest-based advertising from Microsoft, as described above.

Web Beacon and Analytics Services
	
Some Microsoft web pages contain electronic tags called web beacons. Microsoft uses web beacons to send cookies to Microsoft websites to count visits to those websites and to provide products through co-branding. The electronic communications we send also use web beacons or similar technologies to let us know when a message has been opened or what has happened after it has been opened.
	
In addition to placing web beacons on our websites, we may also work with other companies to place web beacons on their websites and advertisements. This allows us to capture statistics on how clicks on ads placed on Microsoft's websites led to purchases of products or other actions on the advertiser's website. It also allows us to understand activity on Microsoft partner websites in connection with your use of Microsoft products or services.
	
Finally, Microsoft products typically include web beacons and similar technologies provided by third-party analytics providers that we use to gather aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and other activities. These technologies enable analytics providers to set or read their own cookies and other identifiers on your device to collect information about your online activities in applications, websites, and other products. However, we prohibit these analytics providers from using web beacons on our sites to collect or access information that directly identifies you (such as your name or email address). You can opt out of the collection or use of your data by these analytics providers by visiting one of the following sites: Adjust (https://www.adjust.com/opt-out/), AppsFlyer (https://www.appsflyer.com/optout), Clicktale (https://www.clicktale.net/disable.html), Flurry Analytics (https://developer.yahoo.com/flurry/end-user-opt-out/), and Google Analytics (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) (You need to install the add-on for your browser), Kissmetrics (https://signin.kissmetrics.com/privacy/#controls), Mixpanel (https://mixpanel.com/optout), Nielsen (https://priv-policy.imrworldwide.com/priv/browser/us/en/optout.html), Acuity Ads (https://www.acuityads.com/opt-out/), WebTrends (https://ondemand.webtrends.com/support/optout.asp), or Optimizely (https://www.optimizely.com/legal/opt-out/).
	
Other Similar Technologies
	
Our products may use regular cookies and web beacons, as well as other similar technologies, to store and load data files on your computer. Typically, saving specific files locally allows you to maintain user settings and improve speed and performance. However, in addition to storing a user's computer-specific identifier like regular cookies, these technologies can also track user behavior. These technologies include local shared objects (or "Flash cookies") and Silverlight application storage.
	
Local shared objects or "Flash cookies." Websites that use Adobe Flash technology can use local shared objects or "Flash cookies" to store data on your computer. To learn how to manage or block Flash cookies, visit the Flash Player Help page (https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html).
	
Silverlight application storage. Websites and applications that use Microsoft Silverlight technology also have the ability to store data with Silverlight application storage. For information on how to manage and block the storage of such data, see the Silverlight (https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement#mainsilverlightmodule)section of this Privacy Statement.
	
Products provided by your organization 

– notifications to end users
	
If you use Microsoft products using an account provided by your organization (such as a work or school account), your organization may:
		
•	Manage your Microsoft products and product accounts, including managing privacy-related settings for your products or product accounts.
		
•	Access and processing of your data, including interactive data, diagnostic data, and the contents of communications and files associated with your Microsoft products and product accounts.
	
If you lose access to your work or school account (for example, if you change your place of work), you may also lose access to the product and the content associated with that product, including any that you acquired, for products that were signed in to that work or school account.
	
Many Microsoft products are intended for use in organizations, such as schools and businesses. See the Enterprise and Developer Products section of this Privacy Statement. If your organization provides access to Microsoft products, your use of Microsoft products is subject to your organization's policies (if any). If you have any privacy questions, such as requests to exercise your data protection rights, please contact your organization's administrator. When you use social features in Microsoft products, your activity may be known to other users on your network. For more information about social features and other features, see the documentation or help content specific to the Microsoft product in question. Microsoft is not responsible for your privacy or security practices, which may differ from those set forth in this Statement.
	
If you use a Microsoft product provided by your organization, the agreement between Microsoft and your organization governs how Microsoft processes your personal data in connection with that product. Microsoft is committed to providing products to organizations and users, and to create products for enterprise and developers. We process your personal data for Microsoft's business operations in connection with the offering of the products described in the section. As noted above, if you have any questions about Microsoft's processing of your personal data in connection with the provision of products to your organization, please contact your organization. If you have any questions about Microsoft's business operations related to the provision of products to your organization as described in the Product Agreement, please contact Microsoft as described in the How to Contact Us (https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement#mainhowtocontactusmodule) section. For more information about Microsoft's business operations, see Enterprise and Developer Productssection.
	
For Microsoft products offered by kindergarten through high school educational institutions, such as Microsoft 365 Education, Microsoft is doing the following:
		
•	We do not collect or use any personal data of students beyond what is necessary for accredited educational or school purposes.
		
•	We do not sell or rent student personal data.
		
•	We do not use or share student personal data for advertising or similar commercial purposes, such as behavioral targeting of advertising to students.
		
•	We do not create a personal profile of a student unless it supports the purpose of an accredited education or school, or is certified by a parent, guardian, or student of appropriate age.
		
•	We require vendors (if any) with whom we share student personal data to provide educational services to be obligated to implement these similar commitments for student personal data.
	
Microsoft account
	
With a Microsoft account, you can sign in to Microsoft products, as well as products from select Microsoft partners. The personal data associated with your Microsoft account includes credentials, name, contact data, payment data, device and usage data, contacts, activity, and information about your interests and favorites. When users sign in to their Microsoft account, they enable personalization and a consistent experience across products and devices, as well as the ability to use cloud data storage, pay with payment methods stored in their Microsoft account, and other features. There are three types of Microsoft accounts:
		
•	If a user creates their own Microsoft account associated with a personal email address, that account is considered a personal Microsoft account.
		
•	If a Microsoft account is created by a user or an organization (such as work or school) associated with an email address provided to the user by that organization, the account is considered a work or school account.
		
•	If a Microsoft account is created by a user or service provider (such as a cable TV or Internet service provider) associated with an email address that contains that service provider's domain, the account is considered a third-party account.
	
Personal Microsoft account. The data associated with your personal Microsoft account and how you use that data depends on how you use your account.
		
•	Create a Microsoft account. When you create a personal Microsoft account, you will be asked to provide certain personal data. We assign a unique ID number to identify your account and the information associated with it. Some products with payment require a real name, while others can be used by signing in without providing a real name. Some data you provide, such as your display name, email address, and phone number, may help others search and contact you within Microsoft products. For example, other people who know your display name, email address, or phone number may use it to search for and interact with your personal Microsoft Teams. If you create a personal Microsoft account using your work or school email address, your employer or school may have access to your data. In some cases, you may need to change your email address to a personal email address to continue accessing consumer products (such as the Xbox network).
		
•	Sign in to your Microsoft account. When you sign in to your Microsoft account, a sign-in record is created. This includes the date and time, the product you signed in to, the sign-in name, the unique number assigned to your account, the unique identifier assigned to your device, your IP address, and your operating system and browser version.
		
•	Sign in to Microsoft products. When users sign in to their accounts, they can provide even more personalized settings, providing a seamless and consistent experience across products and devices. It also allows you to access and use cloud data storage, pay with payment methods stored in your Microsoft account, and other enhancements and settings. For example, when you sign in, Microsoft makes the information stored in your account available across Microsoft products, so important things are where they need to be. When a user signs in to their account, it remains that way until they sign out. If a user adds a Microsoft account to a Windows device (version 8 or later), Windows automatically signs in to that product when the user accesses a product that uses a Microsoft account on that device. When you sign in, some products display your full name or username or profile picture as part of your use of Microsoft products (if you've added them to your profile). This includes user interactions, social interactions, and public posts. Learn more about your Microsoft account, data, and choices (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2205470).
		
•	Sign in to a third-party product. If you sign in to a third-party product with a Microsoft account, your data will be shared with the third party in accordance with the third-party privacy policy. The third party also receives the version number assigned to the account (a new version number is assigned each time the sign-in information changes) and information that indicates whether the account is disabled. When a user shares their profile data, a third party can display the user's name or username and profile picture (if the user adds a photo to their profile) when the user signs in to that third-party product. If you use your Microsoft account to pay a third-party business, the information stored in your Microsoft account that is necessary to process your payment and order, such as your name, credit card number, billing/shipping address, and related contact information, may be stored by Microsoft from the third-party or contractor (such as a storage agent) It is provided to. Third parties may use or share data received when a user logs in or purchases a product in accordance with their own policies and policies. Please read the privacy statement of each service or product vendor you sign in to understand how the information collected by that product is used.
	
Work or school account. The data associated with a work or school account and how it is used is generally similar to the use and collection of data associated with an individual's Microsoft account.
	
If an account provided by your work or school is managed using Microsoft Entra ID, users can use their work or school account to sign in to Microsoft products such as Microsoft 365 and Office 365, as well as third-party products provided by your organization. If requested by a company, school, etc., users may be asked to provide a phone number or alternative email address for additional security verification. If your organization allows you to sign in to Microsoft products or third-party products that you get using your work or school account.
	
If you use your work or school account to sign in to Microsoft products, keep the following in mind:
		
•	The owner of the domain associated with the user's email address may control the account to access and process user data, such as communications and file content. This includes data stored in products provided to users by your organization and products you obtain yourself.
		
•	Use of the product is subject to your organization's policies, if any. Before you decide to use your work or school account to sign in to a product you obtained, you should review your organization's policies and consider whether you don't mind allowing your organization access to your data.
		
•	If you lose access to your work or school account (for example, if you change your place of work), you may also lose access to the product and the content associated with that product, including any that you acquired, for products that were signed in to that work or school account.
		
•	The privacy and security practices of your organization may differ from Microsoft's, and Microsoft is not responsible for them.
		
•	If your organization controls your use of Microsoft products, contact your organization's administrator if you have any privacy questions, such as requests to exercise data subject rights. Please also see the "Notice to End Users" section of this Privacy Statement.
		
•	If you're not sure whether your account is a work or school account, contact your organization.
	
Third-party accounts. The data associated with a third-party Microsoft account and its use is generally similar to the use and collection of data associated with an individual's Microsoft account. The service provider controls the user's account and can access or delete the account. You should carefully review the terms and conditions provided by the third party and understand what the third party can do with your account.
	
Collection of data from your child
	
For users under the age of 13 specified in jurisdictions, certain Microsoft products and services require parental consent or approval before use, including blocking users under that age or creating an account to access Microsoft services. We will not ask for more data than necessary to provide products to children of that age.
	
Once parental consent or approval is obtained, your child's account will be treated like any other account. In that case, your child can access communication services like Outlook and Teams, freely communicate with other users of all ages, and share data. View parental consent and your child's Microsoft account details (https://support.microsoft.com/help/4090274/microsoft-account-parental-consent-and-child-accounts).
	
Parents can change or revoke previously given consent choices. As a Microsoft Family Group organizer, parents or guardians can manage their child's personal information and settings on the Family Safety (https://account.microsoft.com/family) page and in the Privacy Dashboard (https://account.microsoft.com/privacy). You can view and delete your child's data on the Accounts that require parental consent to create are automatically included as part of the family group of individuals who have consented to create an account. If you don't need parental consent to create a child's account (for example, if your child is over the legally required age for parental consent), the parent or guardian can still use the family group, but you'll need to add your child's account to the family group after the account is created. For more information on how to access and delete your child's data, see:
	
Additional information about the collection of data from children related to Xbox, including more information, is provided below.
	
Accessing and deleting your child's data. For Microsoft products and services that require parental consent, parents can view and delete certain data belonging to their child from the parental privacy dashboard (https://account.microsoft.com/privacy). This includes browsing history, search history, location activity, media activity, app and service activity, and product and service performance data. To delete this data, parents can sign in to the Privacy Dashboard (https://account.microsoft.com/privacy) and manage their child's activities. Parents' ability to access and delete their child's personal information in the Privacy Dashboard depends on the laws of your location.
	
In addition, parents can complete the Privacy Support Form (https://aka.ms/privacyresponse) through the Privacy Support Team (https://aka.ms/privacyresponse) After verification, you can request that we delete the following data along with the data types in the Privacy Dashboard: Software, Setup, Inventory, Device Connectivity and Configuration, Feedback and Ratings, Fitness and Activity, Support Content, Support Interactions, and Environmental Sensors. Authenticated removal requests will be processed within 30 days of receipt.
	
Content such as emails, contacts, and chats can be accessed through the in-product experience. For more information about the data you can control within Microsoft products, see Microsoft's Privacy Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). (https://aka.ms/privacyfaq)
	
If your child's account is not part of a Microsoft family group and you don't have access to their activity in the privacy dashboard, you must submit a request for your child's data using the privacy support form (https://aka.ms/privacyresponse). The Privacy Team will require account verification before processing the request.
	
To delete all of your child's personal information, you must use the "Delete Account" form (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898) to request deletion of your child's account. When you click this link, you will be prompted to sign in with your child's account credentials. Make sure you see the correct Microsoft account on the page, and follow the instructions to request the removal of your child's account. Learn more about how to delete your Microsoft account (https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/how-to-close-your-microsoft-account-c1b2d13f-4de6-6e1b-4a31-d9d668849979).
	
You have a 60-day grace period before your child's account is permanently deleted after you submit a request to delete your child's account, in case you want to undo the account deletion later or need to access the data on your account before it is permanently deleted. During the grace period, the account is subject to suspension and permanent deletion, but it still exists. If you want to reactivate your child's Microsoft account, sign in again within 60 days of the grace period. The account termination will be canceled and the account will be reactivated.
	
What is Xbox? Xbox is Microsoft's gaming and entertainment segment. Xbox hosts an online network made up of software, enabling online experiences across multiple platforms. This network allows children to search and play games, view content, and connect with friends on Xbox and other games and social networks.
	
When a user signs in to Xbox with an app, game, or Xbox console, the device is assigned a unique identifier. For example, if your Xbox console is connected to the Internet and you sign in to your console, it identifies the console you're using and the version of your console's operating system.
	
Xbox will continue to deliver new experiences with client apps that connect to and are supported by networks, such as Xbox services and cloud gaming. When you sign in to an Xbox experience, Microsoft collects essential data to keep these experiences secure, reliable, up-to-date, and working properly.
	
Data collected when you create an Xbox profile. As a parent or guardian, you must consent to the collection of personal data from children under the age of 13 or in accordance with jurisdictional designations. Use permissions to help your child get an Xbox profile and use Xbox on an online network. During the child's Xbox profile, sign in with their Microsoft account and verify that they're the adult host in the Microsoft family group. Collect alternative email addresses or phone numbers to improve account security. If your child needs help accessing their account, we will use this alternative information to verify that they have a Microsft account.
	
Limited information about your child is collected, such as name, date of birth, email address, and region. When your child signs up for an Xbox profile, they get a gamertag (a public nickname) and a unique identifier. When you create an Xbox profile for your child, you consent to the collection, use, and sharing of information by Microsoft based on your privacy and communications settings on the Xbox online network. Your child's privacy and communication settings are the most restrictive by default.
	
Data we collect. When your child uses Xbox services, games, apps, and devices, we collect the following information:
		
•	Xbox sign-in/sign-out dates and times, purchases, and content earned.
		
•	Games played, apps used, game progress, achievements, time played per game, and other statistics about playing.
		
•	Performance data about your Xbox console, Xbox Game Pass, and other Xbox apps, the Xbox network, connected accessories, and network connections, such as software and hardware errors.
		
•	Content that you add, upload, or share over the Xbox network, such as text, photos, and videos captured in games and apps.
		
•	Social activities such as chat data, interactions with other gamers, and connections on the Xbox network (friends you add or people you follow).
	
If you use your Xbox console or the Xbox app on another device that has access to the Xbox network, and that device contains a storage device (hard drive or memory unit), your usage data will be stored on the storage device and sent to Microsoft the next time you sign in to Xbox. The same applies even if you are playing offline.
	
Xbox diagnostic data. If your child is using an Xbox console, Xbox will send the required data to Microsoft. Required data is the minimum amount of data needed to keep your Xbox safe, secure, and up to date and working correctly.
	
Game capture. Any player in a multiplayer gaming session can record video (game clips) and capture screenshots of the view of the gameplay. Game clips and screenshots of other players can capture in-game characters and gamertags during that session. If a player captures a game clip or screenshot on their PC, the resulting game clip may also capture voice chat if the child's privacy or communication settings allow it on the Xbox online network.
	
Subtitles. During real-time ("party") chat on Xbox, players can activate the voice-to-text feature that allows them to view the chat as text. If the player enables this feature, Microsoft will use the resulting text data for the purpose of providing subtitles for chat to users who need them. This data can also be used to provide a safe gaming environment and enforce Xbox's community standards (https://www.xbox.com/legal/codeofconduct).
	
Use of Data. We use the data we collect to improve our game products and experiences when your child uses Xbox, making them safer and more enjoyable over time. The data we collect can also provide our children with a curated experience. This includes connecting children to games, content, services, and recommendations.
	
Xbox data that other users can view. When your child uses the Xbox network, their online presence (which can be set to "Offline" or "Blocked"), gamertag, gameplay stats, and achievement are visible to other players on the network. Your child's Xbox may share information when they play games or communicate with other players on the Xbox network, depending on their safety settings.
	
Security. To make the Xbox network a safe gaming environment and to enforce Xbox's Community Standards, we may collect and review audio, text, images, video, and in-game content (game clips, conversations, and content posted in clubs and games that your child uploads).
	
Anti-fraud and fraud prevention. Providing a fair gameplay environment is important to us. We prohibit cheating, hacking, account theft, and other cheating or cheating activities when your child uses Xbox online games or network-connected apps on their Xbox console, PC, or mobile device. We may use anti-cheat tools, anti-fraud tools, applications, and other technologies to detect and prevent cheating and cheating. Such technologies may use certain information collected from your Xbox console, PC, or mobile device and how you use that device to create a digital signature (called a "hash"). This may include information about your browser, device, activity, game identifiers, and operating system.
	
Xbox data shared with the publisher of the game or app. When a child uses an Xbox online game or networked app on an Xbox console, PC, or mobile device, the publisher of that game or app has access to usage data to help the publisher provide, support, and improve the product. This data may include your child's Xbox user ID, gamertag, and limited account information (such as country and age range), as well as data about in-game communications, Xbox running activity (such as in-game movements and the type of vehicle used in the game), presence on the Xbox network, time spent in the game or app, rankings, statistics, gamer profile, This includes your avatar or gamer icon, friends list, activity feed for your official club, club memberships, and content you create or submit in-game or in-app.
	
Third-party publishers and developers of games and apps have their own independent relationships with users, and the collection and use of personal data is subject to specific privacy policies. To find out how your child's data is used, read the publisher's policy carefully. For example, publishers may disclose or display game data through their own services (e.g., in leaderboards). These policies may be linked from the game or app details page in the Microsoft Store.
	
For more information, see Data sharing with games and apps (https://www.xbox.com/Legal/ThirdPartyDataSharing).
	
To stop sharing your game or app data with site administrators, remove it from all devices where you installed the game or app. Some publishers' access to children's data may be revoked in https://microsoft.com/consent.
	
AI-powered features. Children in certain jurisdictions may have access to AI-enhanced features on Xbox, such as Microsoft's support virtual agent. It allows users to enter prompts with text or voice. Support virtual agents are designed to assist users with support-related questions. To provide responses, these AI-enhanced features use prompts, publicly available support articles, and other relevant data described in the "Personal Data We Collect (https://www.microsoft.com/privacy/privacystatement#mainpersonaldatawecollectmodule)" section or features. Xbox's AI-powered features don't use your child's data to train your model. Learn more about Xbox Support Virtual Agents here (https://support.xbox.com/help/games-apps/xbox-ai/virtual-agent-faq).
	
Manage your child's settings. As a Microsoft Family Group organizer, you can manage your child's personal information and settings on the Family Safety (https://account.microsoft.com/family) page, and you can manage your Xbox profile privacy settings on the Xbox Privacy & Online Safety page (https://account.xbox.com/settings).
	 
You can also use the Xbox Family Settings (https://www.xbox.com/apps/family-settings-app) app to manage your child's experience, including Microsoft Store and Xbox Store consumption on the Xbox network, viewing your child's Xbox activity, and setting age ratings and amount of time spent. Xbox-specific Family Safety settings apply via Xbox on your Xbox console or PC or mobile device, but may not apply on other platforms.

•Legacy.
		
•	Xbox 360。 This Xbox console collects limited mandatory diagnostic data. This data helps you make sure your child's console is working correctly.
		
•	Kinect。 The Kinect sensor is a combination of camera, microphone, and infrared sensor that uses movement and voice to control gameplay. Here are some examples:
		
◦	If selected, you can use your camera to automatically sign in to the Xbox network with facial recognition. This data remains on the console, is not shared with anyone, and can be deleted at any time.
		
◦	In game play, Kinect maps the distance between the joints of the child's body, allowing them to create and play stickman representations.
		
◦	Kinect's microphone allows players to voice chat with each other, even while playing. You can use voice commands with this microphone to control your console, enter games, apps, and search criteria.
		
◦	The Kinect sensor can also be used for audio and video communication.
	
For more information about Kinect, see Xbox Kinect and privacy (https://aka.ms/kinectprivacy/).
	
Other important information about privacy
	
The following is additional information about privacy, such as how we protect your data, where we process it, and how long we store it. For more information about Microsoft and its commitment to privacy, see Microsoft privacy (https://privacy.microsoft.com/).
	
Security of personal information
	
Microsoft is committed to keeping your personal information secure. Microsoft uses a variety of security technologies and techniques to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, personal information collected from users is stored on computers that are only accessible to a limited number of people in controlled facilities. When we send sensitive information, such as credit card numbers and passwords, over the Internet, we use encryption to protect it. Microsoft follows applicable data protection laws. This includes applicable laws regarding security breach notifications.

Where personal data is stored and processed
	
Personal data collected by Microsoft may be stored and processed in your region or in the United States, or in other jurisdictions where Microsoft, its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service provider facilities operate. Microsoft has major data centers in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, India, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Typically, the primary storage location is in the user's region or in the United States (data center backups are often located in other regions). Storage locations are chosen to operate and deliver services efficiently, improve performance, and ensure redundancy to protect data in case of failures or other issues. We have taken the necessary measures to process the data we collect based on this Privacy Statement in accordance with the provisions of this Statement and the requirements of the law.
	
We transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to other countries, some of which are not recognized by the European Commission as having an adequate level of data protection. For example, the laws of such countries may not guarantee the same rights, or there may not be a privacy supervisory authority that can handle complaints. We use a variety of legal mechanisms, including the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) issued by the European Commission under the Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914 to protect data as well as user rights. For more information about the European Commission's decisions on the adequacy of personal data protection in the countries where Microsoft processes personal data, please visit the European Commission website (https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en) article.

Retention of personal data
	
Microsoft retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide the Products, fulfill the transactions requested by users, and to fulfill legitimate purposes, such as complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing contracts. This need depends on the type of data, the agreement between you and us, or the use of each product, so the actual storage period can vary greatly.
	
Other conditions for determining the 
storage period include:
		
•	When customers provide, create, or manage data, are they required to be stored by Microsoft until the customer intentionally deletes it? This includes documents stored in OneDrive, email messages stored in Outlook.com inbox, and more. In such cases, Microsoft aims to save the data until the user actively deletes it (for example, by moving the email from the Outlook.com inbox to the Deleted Items folder and then emptying the folder). If a user empties the Deleted Items folder, the items in that folder will remain on Microsoft's systems for up to 30 days before they are finally deleted (or for other reasons, such as if you exceed the amount of data you can keep in your account, you may need to delete your data sooner).
		
•	Are there any automated controls that allow customers to access and delete their personal data at any time, such as the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard? If not, a short data retention period is generally employed.
		
•	Whether your personal data is confidential. If your personal data is confidential, a short retention period is usually applied.
		
•	Does Microsoft apply and announce specific retention periods for certain types of data? For example, for Bing search queries, the stored search queries are anonymized. As such, IP addresses are permanently deleted after 6 months, and cookies and other inter-session identifiers used to identify specific accounts or devices are permanently deleted after 18 months.
		
•	Does the user agree to long-term retention? In this case, the data will be stored according to your consent.
	
•	Does Microsoft have a legal or contractual or similar obligation to store or delete data? For example, you should consider data retention laws that are enforceable in your applicable jurisdiction, administrative orders regarding the retention of data related to investigations, and data that needs to be stored for litigation purposes. On the other hand, if the law requires the removal of illegal content, we will take action to do so.
	
U.S. State Data Privacy
	
If you are a U.S. resident, we process your personal data in accordance with applicable U.S. state data privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

•	If advertising identifiers are enabled as part of your Windows privacy settings, third parties can access and use them to select and serve ads that appear in your app. This works much the same way that a website accesses and uses a unique identifier stored in a cookie.
		
•	Microsoft may share the data we collect with internal and external partners, such as Xandr, Yahoo, and Facebook (see below). This makes Microsoft products and the ads they appear on them more relevant and valuable to our customers.
		
•	Advertisers can choose to place web beacons on their sites or use similar technologies to help Microsoft collect information such as activity, purchases, and visits on advertisers' sites. We use this data to serve ads on behalf of advertisers.
	
The ads you see may be selected based on the data you process with your personal information, such as your interests and favorites, location, transactions, how you use our products, search queries, and the content you view. For example, if you view content about cars in Microsoft Start, you may see ads about cars. When you search for "pizzerias in Seattle" on Bing, you may see ads for restaurants in Seattle in search results.
	
In addition, you may see ads that are selected based on other information that you have learned about you over time. We use demographic data, location data, search queries, interests and favorites, usage data of our products and sites, and information about users collected from our advertisers and partners' sites and apps. In this statement, we refer to these ads as "personalized ads". For example, if you access game content on xbox.com (https://www.xbox.com/), you may see ads for your game on Microsoft Start. To provide you with personalized advertising, we use the information we collect when your browser interacts with our website (such as your IP address) to combine multiple cookies placed on your device. If you choose not to receive personalized ads, the data associated with these cookies will not be used.
	
When you use Microsoft services, Microsoft may use information about you to provide personalized advertising. If you're signed in with a Microsoft account and have consented to Microsoft Edge using your online activities for personalized advertising, you'll see ads for products and services based on your online activity while using Microsoft Edge. To configure Edge privacy settings, go to Microsoft Edge > Settings > Privacy & services. To configure your Microsoft account's privacy and advertising settings for your online activities across browsers, such as when you visit Microsoft Edge or third-party websites or apps, visit your privacy.microsoft.com (https://privacy.microsoft.com/) dashboard.

Artificial Intelligence and Microsoft Copilot Features
	
Microsoft harnesses the power of artificial intelligence (AI) in many of its products and services, including the incorporation of generative AI capabilities such as the Microsoft Copilot feature. Microsoft's AI deployment and use are aligned with Microsoft's AI Principles (https://aka.ms/RAI) and Microsoft's Responsible AI Standards (https://aka.ms/RAIStandardPDF)The collection and use of personal data in the development and deployment of Microsoft's AI capabilities is consistent with the commitments outlined in this Privacy Statement. Product-specific details provide additional relevant information. Learn more about how Microsoft is using AI.
	
Microsoft Copilot features. Microsoft Copilot (https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-copilot) is Microsoft's everyday AI assistant, designed to help you achieve more through a single experience that runs across different devices, understanding relevant context across the web, PC, and apps to deliver the right skills at the right time. With the help of Copilot, users can start drafting a new Word document, generate PowerPoint presentations when accessing Copilot in the M365 app, quickly find answers to complex search queries online, find related documents and other personal content from other tasks, and create new songs, You can get inspiration to create stories, images, and other content. Copilot is a family of services, and Microsoft's collection and use of data may vary depending on the service and the intended features in a particular scenario.
	
The Copilot website (https://copilot.microsoft.com/) and app (available on iOS and Android) are at the core of the consumer Copilot experience. Within this core experience, users can perform web search, create text, images, songs, or other outputs, and work with other features such as plugins. On websites and apps, users enter a "prompt" that provides instructions to Copilot (for example, "What are the recommended restaurants near me that can accommodate a gathering of 10 people"). To provide a relevant response, Copilot uses this prompt along with the user's location, language, and similar settings to create a helpful response. In some markets, authenticated users can choose to allow Copilot to access their previous prompt history to better customize the product. The Copilot for Consumer product uses the data collected to provide and improve the Copilot service, including providing relevant ads. Users signed in to their account can manage their prompt history in the product and the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard, and can adjust product location, language, and other settings, including additional privacy choices.
	
Copilot will also appear as an assistant for other Microsoft consumer products, such as Bing, Microsoft Edge, and Xbox. In these situations, data processing activities typically align with the primary use of those products. For more information about Copilot features in these products, see the Bing, Microsoft Edge, and Xbox sections of this privacy statement.
	
For example, Bing's Copilot's use and collection of personal data is consistent with Bing's core web search service offerings described in this Privacy Statement. For more information about Copilot in Bing, see Copilot in Bing. Committed to responsible AI (https://aka.ms/ResponsibleAI-NewBing). In Microsoft Edge, Copilot appears in the sidebar experience to help users complete tasks related to the webpage they visit (e.g., "Summarize this page"). This data will be used in conjunction with the Microsoft Edge section of this Privacy Statement.
	
Copilot Pro (https://www.microsoft.com/store/b/copilotpro) is another consumer Copilot offering, offering subscriber priority access to the latest models, improved image creation capabilities, and access to Copilot in Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, OneNote, Excel, and Outlook. The main Copilot Pro website and app have similar data collection, use, and control as Copilot for Consumer, as mentioned earlier. Similar Copilot features are also included in Microsoft 365 Family and Microsoft 365 Personal subscriptions. When Copilot is integrated with Microsoft 365 products, Copilot's data collection is consistent with how we collect and use data as described in the "Productivity and communication" section of this privacy statement.
	
There is also a Copilot offering designed for enterprise users. If enabled by an eligible company, users who log in using Entra ID to access the Copilot for Consumer service will receive Copilot with Commercial Data Protection. This ensures that data collection and use are minimal and aligned with enterprise user expectations. Learn more about Copilot with commercial data protection here (https://learn.microsoft.com/copilot/privacy-and-protections). 
	
Microsoft 365 Copilot, available in Microsoft 365 enterprise services, provides enterprise-level data protection, access to corporate graphs, Copilot within Microsoft 365 and Teams, and additional customization capabilities. The collection and use of data by Microsoft 365 Copilot is consistent with the practices described in the Enterprise and Developer Products section of this privacy statement.

Enterprise and developer products allow you to purchase, subscribe, and use other Microsoft or third-party products and online services that have different privacy practices. These other products and online services are subject to their respective privacy statements and policies.
	
Enterprise Online Services
	
To provide enterprise online services, Microsoft uses data provided by Microsoft uses users (including customer data, personal data, administrator data, payment data, and support data) and data that Microsoft collects and generates in connection with your use of enterprise online services. We process data as described in the Product Terms of Use (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=873404), the Microsoft Products and Services Data Protection Supplement (Product and Services DPA), (https://aka.ms/dpa) and the Microsoft Trust Center (https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/privacy/how-Microsoft-defines-customer-data).
	
Personal Data. The customer is the controller of personal data, and Microsoft processes such data. This is an exception where (a) you process your personal data and Microsoft does secondary processing, or (b) as described in other standard Product and Services DPAs (https://aka.ms/dpa). In addition, as described in the standard Product and Services DPA (https://aka.ms/dpa), Microsoft assumes additional responsibilities as a data controller under the GDPR when processing personal data in connection with the provision of services to Microsoft's corporate customers for the purposes of legitimate business operations. These include invoice and account management, remediation, internal reporting and business modeling, and financial reporting. Personal data is used in the most difficult way to identify an individual, while supporting the processing necessary for business operations. Personal data is aggregated by using statistical data and pseudonymized before using it for business operations. This makes it impossible to identify the individual.
	
Admin data. Admin data is information that you provide to Microsoft when you sign up, purchase, or manage enterprise online services. We use Admin Data to provide enterprise online services, perform transactions, service accounts, detect and prevent fraud, and comply with legal responsibilities. Admin data includes the name, address, phone number, and email address provided by the user, as well as aggregated usage data associated with the account, such as selected controls. If you agree to provide Microsoft with your colleagues and friends for the sole purpose of sending them invitations to use Enterprise Online Services, that information will be included in your Admin Data. When we contact these people, we will include information such as your name and profile picture.
	
We may use Admin Data to inform you about your account, subscription, billing, and renewals for Enterprise Online Services, such as new features, security, or other technical issues, as appropriate. As set forth in the terms of the Agreement, we will also contact you for third-party inquiries regarding your use of the Enterprise Online Services. You cannot stop contacting us for non-promotional purposes. We may contact you about information and offers for other products and services, and we may share your contact information with Microsoft partners. If the services and solutions provided by these partners meet your needs or optimize your use of enterprise online services, limited aggregate information about your organization's account may be shared with the partner. Microsoft will not share sensitive or contact information with authorized partners unless you have sufficient permissions. You can manage your contact settings and update your information within your account profile.
	
Payment data. We use payment data to perform transactions and detect and prevent fraud.
	
Supporting data. When you receive technical support for Enterprise Online Services, you provide data or authorize Microsoft to collect data. We process the support data to provide the support team as described in the Product and Service DPA (https://aka.ms/dpa).
	
Local software and diagnostic data. Some enterprise online services require the installation of local software (such as agents and device management applications) or are enhanced by installing local software. Local software may collect diagnostic data about the use and performance of that software (Product and Service DPA (https://aka.ms/dpa)). That data may be sent to Microsoft and used for the purposes described in the Products and Services DPA (https://aka.ms/dpa).
	
Bing Search Service data. The Bing search service, as defined in the Product Agreement, uses data such as search queries as described in the "Bing (https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement#mainbingmodule)" section of this Privacy Statement.
	
Enterprise and developer software and enterprise appliances
	
Enterprise and developer software and enterprise appliances collect data to operate efficiently and provide the best experience. The data collected depends on the features you use and your configuration and settings, but is generally limited to device data and usage data. You can choose the information you provide to us. Here are some examples of the data we collect:
		
When installing or upgrading enterprise and developer software, we may collect device data and usage data to ensure that you do not encounter any issues.
		
When you use enterprise software or enterprise appliances, we may collect device data and usage data to obtain information about your operating environment and improve security features.

Microsoft uses the data we collect from enterprise and developer software and enterprise appliances to provide and improve the quality of our products, provide customer support, activate our products, communicate with you, and perform our business.
	
Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management platform that includes products that can be installed on their own, such as SQL Server Management Studio. For more information about the types of data collected by Microsoft and how to manage your privacy options, visit the SQL Server Privacy page (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=868444). In your organization, administrators can specify the appropriate usage statistics settings in SQL Server through Group Policy.
	
HoloLens。 HoloLens headsets are standalone Windows computers with Wi-Fi connectivity that enable mixed reality experiences with apps and solutions. Microsoft collects diagnostic data and uses it to troubleshoot issues and keep Windows running on HoloLens up to date, secure, and working properly. Diagnostic data also helps us improve HoloLens and related Microsoft products and services, depending on the diagnostic data settings you choose for your device. Learn more about Windows diagnostic data (https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement#maindiagnosticsmodule).
	
HoloLens also processes and collects data related to the HoloLens experience and device, including cameras, microphones, and infrared sensors. These devices enable movement and voice navigation.
		
You can also use your camera to choose to sign in automatically with iris authentication. To do this, HoloLens takes an image of the iris, measures the distance between key points, generates an individual, and stores it. This information is stored on HoloLens and is not visible to anyone, and users can delete this data from HoloLens at any time.
		
HoloLens also detects hand movements to perform system interactions (menu movements, panning/zooming, scrolling, etc.). This data is processed on the HoloLens device and is not stored.
	
HoloLens derives tracking points based on the user's environment to understand the surface in space. Users can place digital assets on top of it. There are no images associated with this environment data, and they are stored locally on the HoloLens device. You can delete this data from your HoloLens at any time.

Productivity and Communication Products
	
Productivity and communication products are applications, software, and services that can be used to create, store, and share documents, as well as communicate with others.
	
Microsoft 365, Office, and other productivity apps
	
The previous version of Microsoft 365, called Office 365, is a collection of subscription productivity services and applications, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote. Office is a one-time purchase version of these applications available for PC or Mac and includes Access and Publisher. Both Microsoft 365 and Office consist of client software applications and connected online services (web apps in the case of Microsoft 365 for the web), which span many platforms and have a large number of interdependent experiences. For more information about Outlook, see the Outlook (https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement#mainoutlookmodule) section of this privacy statement.
	
Use it to design and recommend file content across a variety of cloud-based Microsoft 365 services, collaborate with others in documents, and take advantage of the capabilities of other Microsoft products and third-party connected products, such as Bing. In your organization, administrators can disable these connected services. You can access privacy controls within Microsoft 365 and Office apps. For more information, see Account privacy settings (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2086538).
	
Office roaming service. The Office Roaming Service helps keep settings up to date, such as privacy settings, across devices running Microsoft 365 or Office apps. When you sign in to an app using a Microsoft account or an account issued by your organization, the service syncs some of your customized settings to Microsoft servers. For example, the service synchronizes a list of recently used documents and the last seen location in the document. When you sign in to another device with the same account, the Office roaming service downloads settings from Microsoft servers and applies them to additional devices. When you sign out of the app, the service removes the settings from your device. Any changes you make to your customized settings will be sent to Microsoft servers.
	
Updates from Microsoft. Microsoft uses services such as Click-to-Run, Microsoft AutoUpdate (for Mac), or Microsoft Update (for some versions of Office) to provide security and other important updates.
	
These services can automatically detect the availability of online updates for Microsoft 365 or Office apps on your device and automatically download and install them.
	
Diagnostic data. Diagnostic data is used to (i) keep Microsoft 365 or Office apps secure and up-to-date; (ii) detect, diagnose, and repair problems; (iii) Product Improvements. This data does not include the user's name or email address, the contents of the user's files, or information about apps that are not related to Microsoft 365 or Office. Users can select "Required" or "Optional" as the level of diagnostic data collection.

must. The minimum data required to keep the app safe and up-to-date and work as expected on the device on which the app is installed.

Options. Collect additional data to help you enhance your product and detect, diagnose, and remediate issues.
	
For more information, see Diagnostic data (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083611).
	
Connected experience. Microsoft 365 will continue to provide even more experiences with client applications that are connected to and supported by cloud-based services. A subset of these connected experiences are also available in Office. If you choose to use Connected Experiences, we collect service data that is necessary to keep these Connected Experiences reliable, up-to-date, secure, and functioning properly. For more information about the required service data, see:
	
Working with others on documents stored in OneDrive or translating the content of a Word document into another language are examples of connected experiences. There are two types of connected experiences:

Experience analyzing content. An experience that uses file content to provide design recommendations, editing suggestions, data insights, and similar functionality. Examples include PowerPoint designers and Word editors.

Experience downloading online content. Experience searching and downloading online content such as templates, images, 3D models, videos, and reference materials to enhance your documents. Templates and PowerPoint Quick Starters are examples.
	
You can access privacy controls within Microsoft 365 and Office client apps. These privacy settings allow you to configure your connected experience. For example, you can enable the Connected Experience to download online content and disable the Connected Experience to analyze the content. Disabling the connected experience also disables other experiences, such as document collaboration and online file storage. However, if you use this privacy setting to disable the connected experience, you will still be able to use certain features, such as mailbox syncing in Outlook and the important services described below. If you're using Microsoft 365 for the web, you can't use these controls because you're already connected to the cloud. For more information about accessing these controls, see Set account privacy (https://support.microsoft.com/office/3e7bc183-bf52-4fd0-8e6b-78978f7f121b).
	
If you disable a specific type of connected experience, the ribbon or menu command corresponding to that connected experience will be grayed out, or an error message will be displayed when you try to use that connected experience.
	
Critical Services. There is a set of services that are essential to the functionality of Microsoft 365 and Office and cannot be disabled. For example, a licensing service that ensures that you have the right licenses to use Microsoft 365 is important. The required service data for these services is collected and sent to Microsoft, regardless of any other settings configured by the user. For more information, see Critical services (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086224).
	
Required service data for the connected experience. When you use a connected environment, your data is sent to Microsoft for processing and providing connectivity capabilities. This data is needed because this information allows you to achieve such a cloud-based connected environment. This data is mandatory as service data.
	
The required service data can include information related to the operation of the connected environment required to maintain the security of the underlying services and keep them up to date. When you use a connected experience that analyzes content, for example, when using the Translate feature in Word, the text that is typed or selected for translation is sent and processed to provide a connected experience. Texts and translations are not stored by our service. The required service data can also include information that connected experiences need to perform their tasks, such as configuration information about Microsoft 365 or Office apps.
	
For more information, see Required service data (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2086313).
	
Copilot and Copilot Pro in Microsoft 365. Copilot features that appear in Microsoft 365 apps as part of a Microsoft 365 Personal, Microsoft 365 Family, or Copilot Pro subscription are available as a separate subscription service in select countries. This feature provides AI-powered productivity features through real-time conversational experiences by applying large language model (LLM) processing to content provided in Microsoft 365 apps such as Word, Excel, OneNote, Outlook, and PowerPoint. Copilot and Copilot Pro in Microsoft 365 are not available with Office desktop licenses. When used in an available Microsoft 365 app, Copilot will only use the content in the file when it asks you to take a specific action on that specific content. For example, you might ask Copilot to help you rewrite a paragraph in a Word document, or you might ask Copilot to generate a to-do list from a notebook in OneNote. As with connected experiences, essential service data is collected while using Copilot. This includes information related to the security, up-to-date, and operations required to keep the underlying services operating as expected.
	 
Copilot Pro: For more information, see Microsoft 365 apps and privacy (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=2258434) and frequently asked questions about Copilot for Microsoft 365 Family and Personal subscriptions (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/frequently-asked-questions-about-copilot-in-microsoft-365-family-and-personal-subscriptions-bda0d6e8-346d-41ce-ab1e-f6af6229c462).
	
Other productivity apps. Microsoft offers some productivity apps that are separate from Microsoft 365 and Office, such as Whiteboard (a free-form digital canvas with touch, type, and pen), To Do (a cloud-based task management app), and Sticky Notes (a desktop notes app).
	
The app uses a variety of cloud-based services to provide other Microsoft product features, such as providing images from Bing for Whiteboard, suggesting task suggestions to add to today's to-do events, and leveraging Outlook and Sticky Notes integration.
	
Use of device features. Some Microsoft 365 applications use specific features to leverage device capabilities. PowerPoint allows you to record presentations with audio and video by accessing your device's microphone and camera with the presentation recording feature. The device's microphone can also be accessed using the speaker coach from the audio recording feature. During the conversation, the speaker coach will provide on-screen guidance regarding pacing, inclusive language, use of profanity, fillers, and even whether or not you are reading the text on the slides. When creating a PowerPoint presentation, you can also use the screenshot and screen cutout feature to capture the content of your screen. Some Microsoft 365 applications, PowerPoint, Word, and OneNote, provide dictation for connected experiences that allow you to create content while using a microphone using speech-to-text. Word and OneNote use a microphone in a connected transcription experience, or use voice audio recording to convert audio recorded directly into a text transcript separated by each speaker. OneNote allows you to use your camera to insert photos and record videos. To Do, Whiteboard, and all Microsoft 365 apps have a sharing feature that accesses your contacts, allowing you to share documents with others in your contact list. The application will not access the features of your device until you start using this feature.
	
You can manage your microphone and camera access settings in the Windows Privacy Settings menu. Go to Start > Settings > Privacy or Privacy & Security. For more information about how to control privacy settings in your app, see What Windows privacy settings apps use (https://support.microsoft.com/windows/windows-privacy-settings-that-apps-use-8b7f2cf4-c359-bf99-0f69-2123cc9ddfc1).
	
Microsoft family
	
This section applies to Microsoft Family Safety M365 products, where family groups can connect via the Microsoft Family Safety app on Windows, Xbox, or mobile devices. If you choose to create or join a family group, review the information in Microsoft Family Safety (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/microsoft-family-safety-bb97220e-9dd8-4b4a-9d15-8194d5941dc5) carefully.
	
Microsoft Family Safety helps parents create a safe environment for family groups with digital content filtering, screen time limits, Microsoft and Xbox Store spending, age rating settings for apps and games, and location sharing. For information about how Microsoft collects and uses your child's data, see the Collection of data from your children (https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement#maincollectionofdatafromchildrenmodule)section of the Privacy Statement. If you are using Microsoft Family Safety on Windows, see the Windows See the Security and Safety Features section (https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement#mainsecurityandsafetyfeaturesmodule) for additional information.
	
To enable Family Safety Controls on your child's account, your child's account must be part of a family group. Accounts that require parental consent to create are automatically included as part of a family group of individuals who have consented to create a child's account. For accounts that don't require parental consent to create, the parent or guardian must add the account to the family group to use Family Safety Controls.
	
When you enable your child's Family Activity Report, Microsoft collects details about your child's device usage, including search, web, app, and gaming activity, and provides you with a report of their child's online activity. Activity reports are periodically deleted from Microsoft servers.
	
Certain Family Safety features, such as Location Sharing, Drive Safety, Drive Sharing, Location, and Location Notifications, use your location when enabled. For example, when you enable location sharing, your device uploads your location data to the cloud and shares it with other users in your family group. Microsoft will only keep the last known location as part of the location-sharing feature (each new location replaces the previous location). When you enable Drive Safety, your location is used to record your driving habits, such as whether you are driving within driving limits, whether you are using your phone while driving, and whether you have accelerated or braked suddenly. These reports are uploaded to the cloud, and you can choose to share the Drive reports with family groups. You can turn off these location features at any time in Family Safety settings. You can manage your device's location data in the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard. Learn more about Family Safety and location data (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/location-based-experiences-in-microsoft-family-safety-48704c11-da47-05c3-6c75-e032d54bc563).
	
Microsoft Launcher
	
Microsoft Launcher is an Android app that provides a highly customizable app launcher experience on Android devices.
	
You can use Microsoft Launcher with a personal or work account, or without an account. However, if you don't grant specific permissions, some features may be restricted.
	
To use Microsoft Launcher, you need to install the application on your Android device, and you need optional permissions to enable the following features:
	
Microsoft Copilot。 Once signed in with your personal Microsoft account, you can seamlessly use Copilot features such as chat, web search, voice search, and Image Search. Some Copilot features require access to device features, such as the device's camera, microphone, photos, and videos. For more information, check out our section on AI and Copilot features. Learn more about Copilot's terms of service here (https://www.bing.com/new/termsofuse). 
	
Grance View Feed. Glens View helps you organize your daily activities, such as Outlook calendars, to-do lists, sticky notes, and recent documents in the M365 app. When you sign in with a personal or work account, your data is synced across devices signed in to the same account and is available in a personalized experience. You can also see recent activity, such as recent photos and app usage, but you'll need permission to access your device's photos, files, and app usage data.
	
News Feed. When you sign in with your Microsoft account, you can get personalized news feeds and ads in the Launcher news feed. This is synchronized across all your devices. You can also give Microsoft Launcher permissions to access your location to receive locally curated news. You can use the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard to manage your ad preferences and customize your experience.
	
Weather Notifications. Microsoft Launcher uses MSN Weather to receive the latest and most important weather changes on your home screen. You can allow the Launcher to access your current location or provide your zip code to receive the latest local weather information.
	
Backup and Restore: Microsoft Launcher's backup and restore feature allows you to easily transfer between phones and experiment with different home screen settings. Backups can be stored directly on your device or in a OneDrive account associated with your Microsoft account, making them easily accessible.
	
Microsoft Launcher supports Android's work profile feature, allowing you to maintain a clear boundary between personal and work data on your device. This means you can securely access workplace resources without mixing them with your personal apps or data.
	
Learn more about Microsoft Launcher and its supported features here (https://support.microsoft.com/topic/using-microsoft-launcher-on-android-c59f2824-0218-ae6d-3666-d93a7fc537e0).
	
Microsoft Teams
	
This section applies to Teams for consumers. If you're using Teams with a school or work account, see Enterprise and developer products (https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement#mainenterpriseservicesmodule) in this privacy statement.
	 
Teams is an all-in-one collaboration and communication hub. With Teams, you can stay connected with your peers over any period of time. In Teams, you can make use of voice and video calls to call your contacts. Teams makes it easy to find your friends, files, photos, conversations, tasks, and calendars in one convenient and secure place. Teams allows you to store sensitive information such as passwords, reward numbers, and login information and share them with others in Teams. You can also share your location with friends and family with permissions.
	
As part of providing these features, Microsoft collects data about the use of features and information about the time and users associated with communications. Microsoft may share this information with enterprise users when they interact with end users using school or work accounts through meetings and chats. For example, if you have a Teams chat with a user who uses Teams associated with your school account, Microsoft may share information with that user's school as part of providing the Teams service.
	 
Search for your Teams contacts. Your Teams profile contains the information you provided when you set up your Microsoft account. To help others find you in Teams (or products that work with your personal Teams, including Teams for Enterprise), your Teams profile may be included in the Teams public search directory and appear in Teams. Depending on your settings, Teams users can search for you by your name, email address, and phone number. Your profile includes your username, avatar, and any other data you choose to add to your profile or show to others. When you interact with end users in your organization in chats and meetings, enterprise users and their end users may see a Teams profile.
	 
Teams contacts. With permission, Teams periodically syncs your device with Outlook contacts and checks for other team users who match your contacts on your device or in your Outlook address book. You can always manage your contacts and stop syncing at any time. If you choose to stop syncing your devices or Outlook contacts, or if your device is inactive, any contacts that didn't match during the sync process will be removed from Teams. If you want to invite someone you know on your device or Outlook to a conversation, you can invite them directly on a one-on-one basis, or Microsoft can send you an invitation to a group conversation via SMS or email on your behalf. Users who do not want to receive messages can be blocked. You can also report the issue to Microsoft.
	
Notifications to non-user contacts. If the device or Outlook contact you choose to sync with your Teams contacts, the Teams user's device, or the Outlook address book, displays information, Microsoft may process the data to determine if the user is currently in Teams. Allow users and Teams users to invite to the service via SMS, email, and more. As long as the Teams user is active in Teams on their device and continues to enable contact syncing with the applicable device or service, your information will be stored on Microsoft's servers, and Microsoft will periodically process your information as part of the contact sync experience for Teams users, and you will subsequently use the Check if you have participated.
	
Learn more about how we handle your information in connection with the contact sync feature provided to Teams users (https://support.microsoft.com/topic/cdf3c478-df79-4efe-8c4b-8202078a1a67).
	
If you choose to join Teams, you will appear as a new Teams contact for a Teams user with information on your device or in your Outlook address book. As a Teams user, if you don't want to receive communications from other Teams users, you can block them. In addition, you can report your concerns to Microsoft.
	
Third-party contacts. You can also choose to sync contacts from third-party providers. If you choose to unsync third-party contacts in Teams, all third-party contacts will be removed from Teams. If you agree to use these third-party contacts in other Microsoft apps and services, these contacts will continue to be available in other Microsoft apps and services.
	
You can remove third-party contacts from all Microsoft apps and services by removing third-party accounts from Teams. Keep in mind that removing a third-party account from Teams may affect your experience with other Microsoft apps and services that use that third-party account.
	 
Teams calendar. You can also choose to sync your Teams calendar with your third-party provider's calendar. You can stop syncing your Teams calendar at any time by removing a third-party account from Teams. If you have consented to the use of third-party data in other Microsoft apps and services, please note that deleting this third-party account data in Teams may affect your experience in other Microsoft apps and services.
	
Location sharing. You can share a fixed or dynamic location with a user or group in Teams. This is controllable and can be stopped at any time. You can get parental consent or share your child's location with a Microsoft Family Group parent in a group.
	
Push notifications. To notify you of incoming calls, chats, and other messages, Teams uses the notification service on your device. On many devices, such services are provided by other companies. For example, in order to let users know who is calling or to show the first few characters of a new chat, Teams must tell the notification service to provide a notification to the user. This information will be used by the company providing the device's notification service in accordance with its own terms and privacy policies. Microsoft is not responsible for the personal data collected by the provider of the notification service.
	
If you don't want to use the notification service for incoming Teams calls and messages, disable the notification service in your device's settings.
	
Chat and conferencing with end users of enterprise users. Many Microsoft products are intended for use by organizations, such as schools and businesses, as well as individual users. If you use Teams with a work or school account, see the Enterprise and developer products section (https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement#mainenterprisedeveloperproductsmodule) of this privacy statement See When you participate in a Teams meeting or chat with your organization's end users, the data you share with your end users is subject to your organization's policies, if any. Privacy inquiries related to data shared through chats and meetings with your organization's end users, including requests to enforce data protection rights, should be directed to your organization's administrator. Microsoft is not responsible for your privacy or security practices, which may differ from those set forth in this Statement.
	
OneDrive
	
OneDrive allows you to store and access your files on virtually any device. You can also share files and collaborate with others. Depending on the version of the OneDrive application, users may be able to sign in and access both OneDrive for personal and business purposes. Sign in with a personal Microsoft account for personal use, or with a work or school account to use Microsoft 365 or Office 365 for business.
	
When you use OneDrive, we collect data about your use of the service, not just the content you store, to provide, improve, and protect the service. For example, the content of OneDrive documents may be indexed so that users can search for it later, or location may be used to search for photos based on where they were taken. We may also collect device information to provide you with a personalized experience, such as syncing content across multiple devices or roaming through customized settings.
	
When a user saves content to OneDrive, the sharing permissions in the folder where the content is located are carried over. For example, if you save content in a public folder, it will be public and visible to anyone who can view that folder on the internet. When you save content in a private folder, it becomes private.
	
When you share content from a device synced with your OneDrive account to a social network, such as Facebook, the content is uploaded to that social network or a link to the content is posted to the social network. This allows you to access your content from everyone on the social network. To remove content, you need to remove it from social networks (if it was actually uploaded, not a link post) and OneDrive.
	
If you share OneDrive content with a friend via a link, they'll receive an email with the link. The link contains an authorization code, so anyone with the link can access the user's content. When a user's friend sends a link to someone else, they can access your content even if they don't choose to share it with others. To revoke permission for content in OneDrive, sign in to your account and select the specific content for which you want to manage permission levels. To effectively disable a link, revoke permission for the link. Unless the user sets up to share the link again, they cannot use a link that allows them to access the content.
	
Files managed in OneDrive for Business are stored separately from files stored in Personal OneDrive. OneDrive for Business collects personal data for authentication, such as email addresses and passwords, and transfers them to Microsoft and providers of Microsoft 365 or Office 365 services.
	
Outlook
	
Outlook is a product designed to improve communication and productivity, and includes Outlook.com, Outlook applications, and related services.
	Outlook.com。 Outlook.com is Microsoft's flagship consumer email service that includes email accounts with addresses ending in outlook.com, live.com, hotmail.com, and msn.com. Outlook.com has the ability to connect friends with each other on social networks. You must create a Microsoft account to take advantage of Outlook.com.
	
When you delete a message or item from a mailbox in Outlook.com, the item is typically moved to the Deleted folder and stored in the Deleted folder for approximately 7 days unless you return it to your inbox, or unless you empty the folder or the service automatically empties the folder (from the date of the first of these actions). When the Deleted Items folder is empty, the deleted items remain in the system for up to 30 days before they are eventually deleted (unless you are legally required to keep that data for a longer period of time).
	
Outlook application. The Outlook client application is software that you can install on your device to manage mail, calendar items, files, contacts, and other data on mail, file storage, other services (such as Exchange Online and Outlook.com), and servers (such as Microsoft Exchange). Outlook applications, including the new Outlook for Windows app, allow you to use multiple accounts from different providers, including third-party providers.
	
To add an account, you must grant Outlook permissions to access data from your email and file storage services.
	
When you add an account to Outlook, the email, calendar items, files, contacts, settings, and other data in that account automatically sync with your device. If you're using the Outlook mobile application, your data will also be synced with Microsoft servers, and even more features will be available. For example, you can do fast search, filter less important emails with personalized settings, and add email attachments from linked file storage providers without leaving the Outlook application. If you're using the Outlook desktop application, you can choose whether to sync your data with our servers. You can delete your account at any time, and you can change the data you sync with your account at any time.
	
If you're adding an account provided by an organization, such as a company or school, the owner of your organization's domain may implement policies and controls (for example, requiring multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe device data), which may affect how you use Outlook.
	
Use of device features. For Outlook clients that support this feature, users can use the dictation feature to dictate and send the content of an email. The dictation feature can be configured to use the device's microphone or any other microphone that the user can connect to the device, such as a pair of microphone-enabled headphones. Outlook can also use your device's location to provide weather information for your current location or to search for nearby locations.
	
For more information about the data that the Outlook application collects and processes, see the Microsoft 365 (https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement#mainofficeservicesmodule) section of this privacy statement.
	
You can use Skype Dialpad to make and receive calls to landline and mobile numbers. This section describes the consumer version of Skype. If you're using Skype for Business, see the Enterprise and developer products (https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement#mainenterpriseservicesmodule) section of this privacy statement.
	
To provide these features, Microsoft collects usage data about your communications, such as the date and time of your communication, and the number and username that are part of your communication.
	
Compatible with Teams. Skype users can also use their Skype account to sign in to Teams. If you use your Skype credentials to log in to Teams, you can use Teams to chat and call other Teams users, and you can access your Skype missed calls and chat history through Teams. For more information about Teams, see the Microsoft Teams section (https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement#mainteamsmodule) of this privacy statement. 
	
Emergency calls from Skype dial pads in the United States. When you enable location sharing for emergency calls, your location is collected periodically so that Microsoft can share your location with your emergency service provider if you dial 911. Your location will only be shared if you initiate a 911 call with location sharing enabled for emergency calls.
	
Partner companies. We have partnered with other companies to allow Skype to be provided through their services. If you use Skype through a company other than Microsoft, the company's privacy policy will govern your handling of your personal data. We may access, transfer, disclose, and retain your data to comply with applicable laws, respond to valid legal process, or assist our partners and local businesses in complying with laws and legal process. Such data includes private content, such as stored video messages, voicemails, file transfers, and instant message content.

Skype Manager。 With Skype Manager, you can manage Skype usage for your group (such as a family) in one place. As a Skype Manager administrator, users who have set up a group can view usage patterns (traffic data, purchase details, and so on) of members in the group who have consented to access their information. The information you add, such as your name, can be viewed by other users in that group. Members of the group can revoke their consent to Skype Manager by visiting the Skype account page (https://login.skype.com/login).

Bing
	
Bing services include search and mapping services, as well as other apps and programs described in this section. Bing services collect and process data in various formats, including hand-typed or typed text, audio data, and images. Bing services are also included in other Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, some features of Windows (called Bing-provided operating environments).
	
When you perform a search or use a Bing-powered experience feature that involves performing a search or entering a command, Microsoft may use the search or command you specify (in the form of text, audio data, or images) to include your IP address, location, a unique identifier contained in cookies or similar technologies, the date and time of the search, Collect along with your browser configuration. For example, if you use Bing's speech-enabled services, your speech and performance data related to speech features will be sent to Microsoft. For more information about how Microsoft manages your speech data, see Speech recognition technology (https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement#mainspeechrecognitionmodule). Also, if you use Bing's image-enabled service, the images you use will be sent to Microsoft. When you use a Bing-powered experience (such as Bing Search) to search for a specific word or phrase in a web page or document, the context before and after is also sent to Bing along with that word or phrase to provide contextually relevant search results.
	
AI-enhanced Bing search. Bing Search includes AI-enhanced web search capabilities that use Bing's Microsoft Copilot. Support users by providing relevant search results, reviewing and summarizing from across the web, refining research queries through chat experiences, and improving creativity by helping users create content. Bing's Copilot's use and collection of personal data is consistent with Bing's core web search services, which are discussed in this section. For more information about Copilot in Bing, see Copilot in Bing. Committed to responsible AI (https://aka.ms/ResponsibleAI-NewBing).
	
Search suggestions. For search suggestions, Microsoft is sent the characters you type and click items in Bing-powered experiences (such as search suggestions and suggestions in the Microsoft Edge browser) to perform searches. This allows Microsoft to provide you with the right search suggestions based on the type of character you are searching for. To turn this feature on or off, go to Bing Settings (https://www.bing.com/account/general) when using Bing Search. There are other ways to control this feature in other Bing-powered experiences, such as the Microsoft Edge browser.

Bing Experience Enhancement Program for Bing Desktop and Bing Toolbar。 If you use Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar and participate in the Bing Experience Enhancement Program, we also collect information about how certain Bing applications are used, such as the address of the website you visit, to improve search rankings and relevance. For privacy reasons, we do not use the data collected by the Bing Experience Improvement Program to identify you, contact you, or target you with advertising. You can disable the Bing Experience Enhancement Program at any time through Bing desktop or Bing Toolbar settings. Finally, we delete the information we collect through the Bing Experience Improvement Program after 18 months.
	
Retention and anonymization. We anonymize stored search queries. To do so, IP addresses are permanently deleted after 6 months, and cookies and other inter-session identifiers used to identify specific accounts or devices are permanently deleted after 18 months.
	
Microsoft account personalization. Some Bing services offer an enhanced experience when you sign in to your personal Microsoft account. For example, you can sync your search history across multiple devices. You can use these personalization features to customize your interests and favorites and connect your account to third-party services. If you want to manage your personal settings, go to Bing Settings (https://www.bing.com/account/general) or if you want to manage your users' data, visit the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard (https://account.microsoft.com/privacy).

The Bing Search History service in Bing Settings allows you to double-check the search criteria you enter and the results you click on in Bing Search using your browser. The service also allows you to clear the search history on your device. Conversations in Microsoft Copilot in Bing are also remembered as "recent activity." It saves a history of previous Recent Activity and gives the chat name based on the first query of the chat by default. While using the service, Recent Activity appears on the right side of the chat window. When you clear your history, you won't see it in your search or chat history, but it won't delete any information in your Microsoft search logs. This information is stored in an anonymized state or processed as specified in the Privacy Dashboard, as described above. If you're signed in to your work or school Microsoft account using Microsoft Search in Bing, you can export your Microsoft Search search history on Bing, but you can't delete it. As a service administrator for Microsoft Search in Bing, you can view aggregated search history across all enterprise users, but you can't view specific searches by user.

When you select a search result or ad on the Bing search results page and visit the desired website, the destination website receives the standard data that the user's browser sends to all the websites it navigates. For example, the user's IP address, browser type and language, and the hostname before the move (in this case, https://www.bing.com/).
	
Share data from Bing and Bing Device Experiences with third parties. Some of the anonymized data (non-user-identifiable data) of Bing and the Bing Equipment Experience will be shared with selected third parties. In this case, we will preemptively remove sensitive data that you include in your search criteria, such as your social security number or credit card number. In addition, Microsoft requires these third parties to keep their data secure and not use it for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was provided.
	
Microsoft Edge
	
Whenever you use a web browser to access the Internet, data about your device ("Standard Device Data") is sent to the websites you are visiting and to the online services you use. Standard device data includes the user's IP address, browser type, language, access time, and referring website address. This data is logged on to the web server of the website or online service. What data is logged on and how it is used depends on the privacy policy of the websites you visit and the web services you use. Certain features of Microsoft Edge, such as accessing Microsoft Start content and connecting the user's experience to content when opening a new tab in the browser, are covered by the "Microsoft Start" section of the Privacy Statement. In addition, Microsoft Edge sends a unique browser ID to specific websites so that Microsoft can develop aggregate data that we use to improve browser features and services.
	
Microsoft Edge for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Microsoft Edge is the default web browser for Windows 10 and later, and is also available for other supported versions of Windows and macOS.
	
For example, data about how the user uses the browser, such as browsing history, web form data, temporary Internet files, and cookies, is stored on the user's device. Users can delete this data using Delete browsing history.
	
Microsoft Edge allows you to capture content such as and save it to your device:

Settings and more. You can manage your favorites, downloads, history, extension information, and collections.

collection. You can collect text, images, videos, and other content on your browser's notes page. When you drag content into a collection, it is cached on your device and can be removed from the collection.

Pin a website to the taskbar. You can pin your favorite websites to the Windows taskbar. Because websites can identify web pages that users have pinned, you can provide users with a notification badge to let them know that there is a new item to refer to on the website.
	
Microsoft collects the data necessary to provide you with the features you have requested in Microsoft Edge. When you sign in to Microsoft Edge using a Microsoft personal, work, or school account, Microsoft Edge syncs browser data stored on your device across other signed-in devices. You can choose which browser data you want to sync, such as favorites, browsing history, data related to extensions, settings, open tabs, autofill form entries (such as name, address, and phone number), passwords, payment information, and other types of data that become available. If you choose to sync extensions from third-party web stores, copies of these extensions are downloaded directly from the synced device's web store. If you turn on Password Monitor, your stored credentials are hashed, encrypted, and sent to Microsoft's Password Monitor service to alert you if credentials are detected as part of a malicious attack or breach. After the check is complete, this data is not retained by Microsoft. You can disable or configure sync in Microsoft Edge settings.
	
When you sign in to Microsoft Edge with a Microsoft personal, work, or school account, Microsoft Edge saves your account's privacy settings. Microsoft Edge uses saved preferences to transfer account privacy settings between signed-in devices, such as during Windows device setup or when you sign in to Microsoft Edge with that account on a new device.
	
Microsoft Edge search suggestions and suggestions use a user's search queries and browsing history to suggest faster browsing and more relevant search suggestions. Microsoft Edge sends the information entered in the browser address bar to the default search provider configured in the address bar, and when a character is typed, it will suggest a search. You can turn off these features at any time in your browser settings. To provide search results, Microsoft Edge sends search queries, standard device information, and location information (if location is enabled) to the default search provider. If Bing is your default search provider, we will use this data as described in the "Bing" section of this Statement.
	
Microsoft Edge collects and uses data from search activity across the web, including websites that are not owned or operated by Microsoft, to improve Microsoft services, such as Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Bing, and Microsoft News. This data may include your search queries, the search results you see, the demographic information that is part of the search results, and your interactions with those search results, such as the links you click. Microsoft Edge anonymizes the data it collects by deleting data that identifies the individual or device from which it was collected, and retains this data for one year after it is collected. Microsoft does not use this collected data to personalize or serve ads to customers. You can turn off the collection of this data at any time in your browser settings.
	
Microsoft Edge downloads content from Microsoft services to enhance your browsing experience. For example, you can make a pre-rendered site for immediate viewing if data is downloaded to the content, or provide the necessary content for the power functions you use, such as providing a template for a collection.
	
You can also share your Microsoft Edge browsing activity so that we can customize Microsoft Edge and Microsoft services, such as advertising, search, shopping, and news. Microsoft Edge browsing activity includes history, favorites, usage data, web content, and other browsing data. For more information about Microsoft's advertising privacy policy, see the "Ads" section of the privacy statement. In the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard, you can control the use of customized ad browsing activity in the "Show users interested ads" setting. If you disable this setting in the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard, you will continue to receive personalized web experiences, such as search and news, based on your browsing activity. Within Edge settings, "Allow Microsoft to use your browsing activity and other browsing data, such as history, favorites, and usage, to personalize Microsoft Edge and Microsoft services (such as ads, search, shopping, and news)" You can stop sharing your browsing activity in Microsoft Edge. When using the Copilot feature in the Microsoft Edge sidebar, you can choose to allow Copilot in Microsoft Edge to access the content of the webpage you're viewing to provide further insights, such as page overviews. The use of data connected to the Copilot experience is described in this privacy statement in the Bing section.
	
Microsoft Edge collects the diagnostic data you need to troubleshoot issues and keep Microsoft Edge up to date, secure, and working properly. The diagnostic data you need can also help you improve Microsoft Edge and Windows.
	
Apart from the search activity data mentioned above, you can send optional diagnostic data about how you use Microsoft Edge and information about your browser activity. This includes browsing history and search terms that help Microsoft improve Microsoft Edge and other Microsoft products and services. For Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 and later, this information appears when you enable optional diagnostic data. For more information, see the Windows Diagnostics section of the Privacy Statement. For Microsoft Edge for other operating systems, you can use the "Send data about browser usage to help us improve Microsoft products" or "Send us information about the websites you visit in Microsoft Edge to help you search and Microsoft Edge" in your browser settings. When you enable Help improve the product, optional diagnostic information is provided.
	
Diagnostic data collected by Microsoft Edge is sent to Microsoft and stored with one or more unique identifiers. These identifiers help identify individual browser installations on your device and help you understand browser service issues and usage patterns.
	
More information about Microsoft Edge, browsing data, and privacy (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2112165).
	
Microsoft Edge on iOS and Android. Microsoft Edge on iOS and Android devices collects the data needed to provide you with the features you have requested in Microsoft Edge. Microsoft also collects the diagnostic data you need to resolve issues and keep Microsoft Edge up to date, secure, and working properly. The diagnostic data you need will also help you improve Microsoft Edge.
	
In addition, we may share optional diagnostic data about how you use Microsoft Edge and information about the websites you visit (browsing history) for a personalized experience in your browser, Windows, and other Microsoft products and services. This information can also help us improve Microsoft Edge and other Microsoft products and services. This optional diagnostic data is sent to Microsoft if you enable "Share usage data for personal settings" or "Share information about websites you visit" in your browser settings.
	
Diagnostic data collected by Microsoft Edge is sent to Microsoft and stored with one or more unique identifiers. These identifiers allow you to identify individual users of your device and understand browser service issues and usage patterns.
	
Microsoft Edge collects and uses data from search activity across the web, including websites that are not owned or operated by Microsoft, to improve Microsoft services, such as Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Bing, and Microsoft News. The data collected by Microsoft Edge may include personal data. However, Microsoft Edge will take steps to scrub and anonymize your data. Microsoft Edge does not use this data to personalize or serve ads to you. You can turn off the collection of this data at any time in your browser settings. More information about search results data for product improvements (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2166676).
	
For more information about the privacy policy for legacy versions of Microsoft Edge (version 44 and earlier), see the Internet Explorer section of the Privacy Statement.
	
Microsoft Translator
	
Microsoft Translator is a machine translation system designed to automatically translate text and voice input across a multitude of supported languages. Microsoft Translator is available as a standalone consumer app for Android, iOS, and Windows. It is also integrated into various Microsoft products, including Translator Hub, Translator for Bing, and Translator for Microsoft Edge. Microsoft Translator processes data about your device and usage, along with text, image, and speech recognition data that you submit. We provide this data to Translator and use it to personalize the user experience and enhance our products. Microsoft has established business and technical methods for anonymizing data sent by users to Translator. For example, when randomly sampling text to enhance Translator and Microsoft's speech recognition technology, we remove identifiers or specific text (such as email addresses or sequences) in a sample that may contain personal data. For more information about how Microsoft manages your speech data, see Speech recognition technology (https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement#mainspeechrecognitionmodule).
	
Apart from Microsoft Translator, Microsoft's translation services are available as a feature within Microsoft products and services that have privacy policies that differ from Microsoft Translator. For more information about the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Translator Text API, Custom Translator, and Translator Speech API, see the Privacy Statement in Enterprise and Developer Products section. For information about the translation capabilities of Microsoft 365 apps, see the Productivity and communication products (https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement#mainprodcommproductsmodule)section of this privacy statement.

SwiftKey
	
Microsoft SwiftKey Keyboard and related cloud-based services (collectively, "SwiftKey Services") process data about the words you use and the way you type them, and use this data to understand your writing style to personalize auto-correction and predict text that is adapted to you. It also uses this data to provide various other features, such as emoji prediction.
	
SwiftKey's predictive technology learns how users use language to build a personalized language model. The model displays the words and phrases that users frequently use in that context in an optimized way, while also reflecting the user's unique writing style. The model itself contains words that users often type, sorted to allow predictions based on text already typed by SwiftKey's algorithms. This model uses data from all scenarios where you use the keyboard, such as typing while using an app or browsing a website. SwiftKey's keyboard and model attempt to avoid collecting sensitive data by not collecting data from specific fields that are recognized as containing password or payment data. Unless you have chosen to share your personal data with us (see below for more information), the SwiftKey Services do not record or store any data contained in your model. When you use the SwiftKey service, we also collect data about your device and usage. When you sign in to your SwiftKey account and agree to share the following data, we use anonymized device data, usage data, and model data to analyze the performance of the service and help us improve our products.
	
The SwiftKey service also includes an optional cloud component called a SwiftKey account. When a user creates a SwiftKey account, the language model syncs with the cloud service in the SwiftKey account, so the model is available on the different devices they use, as well as access services such as predictive synchronization, backup, and more. If you create a SwiftKey account, Microsoft will also collect your email address and basic demographic data. All collected data is transferred to our servers via encrypted channels. If you're signed in to your SwiftKey account, you can manage your personal data and SwiftKey account settings on data.swiftkey.com (https://data.swiftkey.com/).
	
As part of your SwiftKey account, you can also opt-in to sharing language and input data to improve Microsoft products and services. If you opt in, SwiftKey may send a short snippet of data about what and how you entered it, along with any associated correction data, to the server for processing. These text snippets are used in various automated processes to verify that the prediction service is functioning properly and to improve the product. To protect your privacy, the SwiftKey service ensures that you do not identify these text snippets. And even if you're using a SwiftKey account, these text snippets won't be linked.
	
If you sign in to your SwiftKey account and opt-in to sharing language and input data, Microsoft processes the shared language data to find new patterns in language usage across your user base. This allows you to improve the base model for individual languages. The language and input data used in this process are aggregated, and words or combinations of words that may belong to individuals or small groups are filtered out.
	
In SwiftKey settings, you can withdraw your consent to share language and input data for product improvement at any time. You can also revoke your consent to the storage of personal data in the SwiftKey Services in your SwiftKey settings. If you withdraw your consent for SwiftKey to store your personal data, all personal data collected through your use of the SwiftKey service will be deleted.
	
From time to time, notifications informing you of product updates and features that interest you may receive on your device. You can disable these notifications at any time in your SwiftKey settings.
	
When using the camera feature with SwiftKey, you can choose to use a third-party lens service to enhance your videos and images. Lenses are a feature that uses augmented reality (AR) to transform your selfies in fun ways, such as making them look like your favorite animals. The SwiftKey keyboard's camera allows you to transform your face or hands by selecting the built-in lens function on the keyboard. Depending on the lens you choose, videos and images may be processed to extract information about the location of different areas of the face or hands. The extracted data will be used solely for the purpose of applying AR effects to faces and hands. This data is not used to personally identify the user. This data is processed only during the session on the device and is deleted immediately thereafter. This data is not sent to SwiftKey or any third party.
	
Windows
	
Windows provides a customized computer environment. Users can seamlessly roam and access services, preferences, and content on their devices, from phones to tablets to Surface Hubs. The key components of Windows reside in the cloud, rather than as static software programs on the device, and the cloud and local elements of Windows are regularly updated to provide the latest improvements and features. To provide you with this computer experience, we collect data about you, your device, and how you use Windows. Windows is designed to be personal, so you can make choices about what personal information we collect and how we use that personal information. If a user's Windows device is managed by an organization to which the user belongs (such as work or school), that organization may use central management tools provided by Microsoft and others to access and process data, and to provide information about the device's settings (including privacy settings), device policies, software updates, and Microsoft or other characteristics of the user's device. In addition, organizations use management tools provided by Microsoft and others to access and process data from their devices, including interaction data, diagnostic data, and the contents of communications and files.
	
Windows Settings (formerly known as PC Settings) is an important component of Microsoft Windows. It provides a convenient interface for adjusting user settings, configuring the operating system, and managing connected devices, allowing you to manage user accounts, adjust network settings, and customize various aspects of Windows. Windows has mechanisms for apps to access various device features, such as the device's camera, microphone, location, calendar, contacts, call logs, and messages, to control access to personal data. Each feature has its own privacy settings page in Windows Settings, so you can control which apps can use each feature. Here are some of the key features of the settings:
		
1	Customization: You can customize various aspects of Windows, such as appearance, language settings, and privacy options. In Windows settings, you can customize Windows by using the microphone to control the volume, and the camera to use the integrated camera and location to change the brightness at night.
2	Manage peripherals: Install and manage peripherals such as printers, monitors, and external drives.
3	Network configuration: Adjust network settings such as Wi-Fi, Ethernet, cellular, and VPN connections, and use the physical MAC address, IMEI, and mobile number if your device supports cellular networks.
4	Manage Accounts: Add or remove user accounts, change account settings, and manage sign-in options.
5	System-level options: Configure display settings, notifications, power options, manage the list of installed apps, and more.
6	Privacy & Security Controls: Configure privacy settings, such as location, diagnostic data collection, and more. By turning it on or off, it fine-tunes individual apps and services to access your device's features.
	
For more information about data collection in Windows, see Overview of data collection in Windows (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=529552). This statement discusses Windows 10 and Windows 11, and references to Windows in this section are related to these product versions. Previous versions of Windows, including Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1, have their own privacy statements.
	
Activation
	
When you activate Windows, a specific product key is associated with the device on which the software is installed. Data about product keys, software, and devices is sent to Microsoft and used to validate your software license. This data is retransmitted if the license needs to be reactivated or authenticated. On phones running Windows, device and network identifiers, as well as the device's initial power-on location, are sent to Microsoft for warranty registration, inventory replenishment, and fraud prevention.
	
Activity history
	
Activity history helps you record what you do on your device, such as what apps and services you use, what files you open, and what websites you visit. Your activity history is created when you use various apps and features, including Microsoft Edge classics, some Microsoft Store apps, and Microsoft 365 apps, and is stored locally on your device.
	
You can turn the setting to save your activity history locally on your device on or off. You can also clear your device's activity history at any time in the Windows Settings app under Privacy > Activity history. Learn more about your Windows activity history (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=865989).

Advertising Identifiers

Windows creates a unique advertising identifier for each user who uses the device. App developers and ad networks can use this advertising identifier for their own purposes, such as serving relevant ads in their apps. If the advertising identifier is enabled, both Microsoft apps and third-party apps can access and use the advertising identifier. This works in much the same way that websites access and use unique identifiers stored in cookies. App developers and ad networks can use ad identifiers to provide personalized experiences across the app and on the web, including showing users relevant ads. Microsoft collects advertising identifiers only for the purposes described herein if they are enabled by you as part of your privacy settings.
	
The advertising identifier setting applies to Windows apps that use the Windows advertising identifier. You can disable access to this identifier at any time by turning off Advertising Identifiers in the Windows Settings app. Re-enabling the old advertising identifier will be reset and a new one will be generated. If a third-party app accesses an advertising identifier, the app's use of the advertising identifier will be governed by the third party's own privacy policy. Learn more about Windows advertising identifiers (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=838419).

The advertising identifier setting does not apply to other methods of interest-based advertising served by Microsoft or third parties, such as cookies used to provide interest-based display advertising on websites. Third-party products that you access or install on Windows may also serve other forms of advertising based on interest, subject to their own privacy policies. Microsoft offers other forms of interest-based advertising on certain Microsoft products, either directly or in partnership with third-party advertising providers. For more information about Microsoft's use of data for advertising, please see the How we use your personal data (https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement#mainadvertisingmodule) section of this statement.
	
diagnosis
	
Microsoft collects Windows diagnostic data to help resolve issues and keep Windows up to date, secure, and working properly. It also helps improve Windows and related Microsoft products and services. While the device is running, diagnostic data is collected and sent to Microsoft periodically and stored with one or more unique identifiers. These identifiers help you recognize users and devices and understand device service issues and usage patterns.
	
There are two levels of diagnostic and activity data: required diagnostic data and optional diagnostic data. Certain product documentation and other documents may list the required diagnostic data as "Basic" diagnostic data and the optional diagnostic data as "Complete" diagnostic data.
	
If your organization (such as an employer or school) uses Microsoft Entra ID to manage the accounts you provide and to enroll your devices in a Windows diagnostic data processor configuration, Microsoft's processing of diagnostic data related to Windows is governed by the agreement between Microsoft and your organization. If your organization uses Microsoft's management tools or asks Microsoft to manage your devices, Microsoft and your organization will use diagnostic and error data from your devices to manage, monitor, and troubleshoot devices managed by your organization, and for other purposes of your organization.
	
Mandatory diagnostic data contains information about the device, its settings and features, and whether it is functioning properly. Mandatory diagnostic data will be collected, including:

Data on devices, connections, and configurations: 

Data about the device, such as processor type, OEM manufacturer, battery type and capacity, number and type of cameras, firmware and memory attributes, etc.

Data about network functionality and connectivity. Such as the device's IP address, mobile network (IMEI, mobile carrier, etc.), and whether the device is connected to a free or paid network.

Data about the operating system and its configuration, such as OS version and build number, region and language settings, diagnostic level, and whether the device is part of the Windows Insider Program.

Data about connected peripherals, such as model, manufacturer, driver, compatibility information.

Data about the applications installed on the device. Such as application name, version, and publisher.

Information about whether the device is ready to update or whether there are any factors that prevent it from receiving updates. Low battery, low disk space, connectivity to paid networks, etc.

Did the update complete successfully or fail?

App activity. Such as the program launched on the device, the length of execution time, and the speed of response to input.

Your Microsoft browser (Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer) activity, including browsing history and search terms.

Enhanced Error Reporting. Such as the memory state of the device when a system or app crash occurs, which may unintentionally contain user content, such as some of the files you were using at the time of the problem.
	
Even if you choose to send optional diagnostic data, some of the aforementioned data may not be collected from your device. Microsoft minimizes the amount of optional diagnostic data it collects from all devices by collecting data only from a subset of devices (a sample). By running the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool, you can display an icon that indicates whether your device is included in the sample and what data is being collected from the device. For instructions on how to download the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool, see Diagnostics & feedback in the Windows Settings app.
	
Certain data items collected by Windows Diagnostics are subject to change to give Microsoft the flexibility to collect the data required for the purposes described. For example, we may need data items that we did not previously collect to help Microsoft troubleshoot the latest performance issues that affect your computer experience or to update newly sold Windows devices. For an up-to-date list of data types collected in Required and Optional Diagnostic Data, see Required (Basic level) Windows Diagnostic Events and Fields (https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/basic-level-windows-diagnostic-events-and-fields) or Windows Optional (Full level) Diagnostic Data (https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/privacy/windows-diagnostic-data)See ". Some of the error reporting information is provided to partners (such as device manufacturers) to help troubleshoot products and services that correspond to Windows and other Microsoft products and services. The use of this information is limited to repairing or improving products and services. Some aggregated and anonymized diagnostic data, such as general usage trends for Windows apps and features, may also be shared with some third parties.

Live Captions
	
Live captions create a transcript of your audio to help you understand the audio content. Live captions allow you to generate captions from any voice, including speech. It doesn't matter if it's audio online, downloaded to your device, or received from your microphone. By default, microphone audio transcription creation is disabled.
	
Captioned audio data is only processed by the device and is not shared with the cloud or Microsoft. Learn more about live captions (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2156465).
	
Location Services and Recordings
	
Windows Location Services. Microsoft operates location services that help determine the exact geographic location of a particular Windows device. The accuracy with which a device can be located depends on the device's performance and may be able to be pinpointed. If you enable location services on a Windows device, or if you grant permission to a Microsoft app to access location information on a non-Windows device, Microsoft collects data and location information about cell towers and Wi-Fi access points. After you delete the data that identifies the person or device about that data, it is added to the location database. This anonymized location information is used to improve Microsoft's location services.
	
Windows services and features, apps that run on Windows, and websites that you open in the Windows browser can access your device's location through Windows, if your settings allow it. Some features and apps require location permissions when a user first installs Windows, some require the user to use the app for the first time, or each time the user accesses the device's location. For more information about some Windows apps that use your device's location, see the Windows apps section of this statement.
	
If an app or feature accesses your device's location and you're signed in with a Microsoft account, your Windows device will also upload that location to the cloud, which can then be used by other apps and services that you've given permission to use your Microsoft account. Microsoft only stores the last known location (replacing the previous location each time a new location is uploaded). You can view or delete this location data from your Microsoft account's privacy dashboard.
	
The Windows Settings app also allows you to see which apps have access to your device's precise location, enable and disable access to your device's location services from specific apps, and disable access to your device's location services. You can also set a default location, and if location services can't detect the exact location of your device, it will use the location you set.
	
There are some exceptions to how your device's location is located, which isn't directly managed by your location settings.
	
Desktop apps are specific types of apps, and location permissions are controlled by Windows location settings and don't appear in the list of apps that can use location. You can download it from the Microsoft Store. You can also download it from the Internet. You can install it using some type of media (such as a CD, DVD, or USB storage device). Learn more about third-party desktop apps and how they can determine your device's location when your device's location settings are turned off (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2007461).
	
If you turn off your device's location settings, some web-based experiences or third-party apps that appear in Windows may use other technologies (such as Bluetooth, IP addresses, cellular modems), or cloud-based location services to determine your device's location with varying levels of accuracy.
	
To help users make emergency calls in an emergency, Windows attempts to determine and share the user's precise location, regardless of the user's location settings. Also, if your device has a SIM card inserted or cellular service is used in other ways, your mobile carrier can also access your device's location. Windows location details (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=529987).
	
Approximate position. When you enable location services, apps that don't have precise location information access to your general location information, such as your city, zip code, or region.
	
Windows' limited feature set uses IP addresses to provide information about the context of the region, such as the weather on the taskbar, when location services are turned off. Learn more about Windows location (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=529987) and how to turn off these features.
	
Find your device. The Find Device feature allows Windows device administrators to search for the device's location from account.microsoft.com/devices. To enable Find Devices, admins must be signed in with a Microsoft account and have location settings enabled. You can use this feature even if other users deny access to your location for all apps. If an administrator tries to locate the device, a notification appears in the user's notification area. Learn more about how to find your device in Windows (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=533063).
	
Recording. Some Windows devices have a recording feature that allows you to save your device's activities, including communication with other users, as audio clips or video clips. If you record a session, the recorded recording is stored locally on the user's device. In some cases, you may choose to send the recorded data to a Microsoft product or service that distributes the recording to the public. Important: Before you record or send any communications, you must understand your legal responsibilities. This may include obtaining the prior consent of all users participating in the conversation or, if necessary, other approvals. Microsoft is not responsible for the recording features or how you use them.
	
narrator

Security and Safety Features
	
Device encryption. Device encryption uses BitLocker drive encryption technology to encrypt personal information and protect personal information stored on the user's device. When device encryption is enabled, Windows automatically encrypts the drive where Windows is installed and generates a recovery key. The BitLocker recovery key for the user's personal device is automatically backed up online in the user's personal Microsoft OneDrive account. Microsoft does not use your personal recovery key for any purpose.
	
Run the malicious software removal tool. The Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) runs on devices at least once a month as part of Windows Update. MSRT checks the device for infections caused by individual, associated malicious software ("malware") and removes any infections found. If malware is present on your device, running MSRT will remove the malware listed on the Microsoft support website. During the malware check, a report is sent to Microsoft with information about detected malware, errors, and other data about the device. To prevent MSRT from sending this data to Microsoft, disable the MSRT reporting component.
	
Microsoft family. Parents can use Microsoft Family Safety to understand how their children are using their devices and set boundaries. If you choose to create or join a family group, click Microsoft Family Safety (https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/microsoft-family-safety-bb97220e-9dd8-4b4a-9d15-8194d5941dc5) Please check the information carefully. If you live in a region that requires permission to create an account to access Microsoft services, you may be asked to obtain parental consent or provide parental consent.

Microsoft Defender SmartScreen and Smart App Control. Microsoft strives to protect your device and passwords from insecure apps, files, and web content.
	
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen helps protect you when you use Microsoft services by identifying threats to your customers, devices, and passwords. These threats can include potentially unsafe apps or web content that Microsoft Defender SmartScreen detects when reviewing websites visited, files downloaded, and apps installed and run. Web and app content checks with Microsoft Defender SmartScree send data about content and devices to Microsoft. This includes the full web address of the content. If additional analysis is required to identify security threats, information about suspicious websites or apps, such as the content displayed, the sounds played, and the application's memory, may be sent to Microsoft. This data is used only for security purposes in detecting, protecting, and responding to security incidents, identity theft, fraud, or other malicious, deceptive, or illegal activity. If Microsoft Defender SmartScreen detects that content is dangerous, users will see a warning instead of the content. Microsoft Defender SmartScreen can be turned on or off in the Windows Security app.
	
When supported, Smart App Control can help check for software installed and running on the device to determine if there is malicious software, potentially unwanted software, or other threats to the user and device. On supported devices, Smart App Control starts in evaluation mode, and the data collected for Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, such as file name, file content hash, download location, and digital certificate for files, is used to protect the device by using Smart App for additional security protection. It is used to determine if you are a good candidate to use the control. Smart App Control is not enabled and is not blocked in evaluation mode. Because smart app controls can interfere with legitimate tasks that users intend to do – such as developers who use a lot of unsigned files, some devices may not be good candidates. If you're a good candidate for Smart App Control, it's automatically enabled and provides additional protection to your device beyond Microsoft Defender SmartScreen. Otherwise, Smart App Control is unavailable and turned off completely. If your device isn't supported or isn't a good candidate for Smart App Control, Microsoft Defender SmartScreen can still help protect your device. If Smart App Control is enabled and identified as malicious, potentially unwanted, or unknown or unsigned, it will be blocked and notified before you can open, run, or install the app. Learn more about Smart App Control (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185232).
	
When you check a file with Microsoft Defender SmartScreen or Smart App Control, data about that file is sent to Microsoft. This includes the file name, hash of the file content, download location, and the file's digital certificate.
	
You can turn off Smart App Control in the Windows Security app.
	
Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Microsoft Defender Antivirus detects malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content on your device. If your device isn't actively protected by other anti-malware software, Microsoft Defender Antivirus is automatically enabled to protect your device. When Microsoft Defender Antivirus is enabled, the security status of your device is monitored. If Microsoft Defender Antivirus is enabled or running (because regular scans are enabled), a report with data about suspected malware or other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content will automatically be sent to Microsoft. In some cases, they may send files that may contain malicious content, such as malware or unknown files, for further inspection. If the report may contain personal information, the report will not be sent automatically and will be prompted for review by the user before submission. You can also configure Microsoft Defender Antivirus to prevent reports and suspected malware from being sent to Microsoft.
	
Voice recognition, voice activation, hand-drawn typing, keyboard typing
	
Speech recognition. Microsoft offers both device-based speech recognition capabilities and cloud-based (online) speech recognition technology.
	
If you turn on the online speech recognition setting, your app will be able to use Microsoft cloud-based speech recognition. In addition, Windows 10 allows you to use dictation within Windows with online speech recognition settings.
	
When you enable speech recognition during HoloLens device setup or Windows Mixed Reality installation, you can use your voice for commands, dictation, and app interactions. Both device-based speech recognition and online speech recognition settings are enabled. With both settings enabled, when the headset is on, the device always listens for your voice input and sends voice data to Microsoft's cloud-based speech recognition technology.
	
When using Microsoft's cloud-based speech recognition technology, whether enabled in your online speech recognition settings or interacting with HoloLens or voice typing, Microsoft provides speech recognition services by collecting and using voice recordings to create text transcriptions of spoken words in your speech data. Microsoft will not store, sample, or listen to audio recordings without your permission. For more information about how Microsoft manages your speech data, see Speech recognition technology (https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement#mainspeechrecognitionmodule).
	
You can also use device-based speech recognition without sending voice data to Microsoft. However, Microsoft's cloud-based speech recognition technology is more accurate than device-based speech recognition. If you turn off the Online Speech Recognition setting, speech recognition services (such as Live Captions, Narrator, and Voice Access) that use only device-based recognition that are cloud-agnostic will work, and Microsoft will not collect speech data.
	
You can disable online speech recognition at any time. This will stop apps that rely on your online speech recognition settings from sending voice data to Microsoft. If you're using a HoloLens or Windows Mixed Reality headset, you can also disable device-based speech recognition at any time. Disabling it prevents the device from hearing your voice input. Learn more about Windows speech recognition (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=874646).

Activation by voice. Windows provides supported apps with the ability to respond and take actions based on voice keywords specific to that app.
	
If your app is allowed to listen for voice keywords, Windows will actively listen for these keywords with your microphone. Once the keyword is recognized, the app can access the user's voice recording, which can process the recording, take action, respond with voice responses, and more. The app may send voice recordings to its own service on the cloud and process commands. Each app must ask for the user's permission before accessing the voice recording.
	
In addition, voice activation can be enabled when the device is locked. When enabled, the relevant app can continue to listen to voice keywords with the microphone and activate any user speaking near the device while the device is locked. When the device is locked, the app can access the same list of features and information as if the device is unlocked.
	
You can disable voice activation at any time. Learn more about voice activation in Windows (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=874646).
	
If you turn off voice activation, some third-party desktop apps and services may still listen for your microphone and collect your voice input. Learn more about third-party desktop apps and how they can access your microphone even when the setting is turned off (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2007461).
	
Voice input. In Windows 11, dictation has been updated and renamed to voice typing. Voice input uses both device-based and online speech recognition technologies to enhance speech-to-text services. You can also provide audio clips to improve your voice typing. If you choose not to provide audio clips, you can still use voice typing. You can change your selection at any time in the dictation settings. Microsoft will not store, sample, or listen to audio recordings without your permission. Learn more about Microsoft and voice data (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2145715).
	
Voice access. Windows allows everyone, including those with motor disabilities, to control their PC and use their voice to create text. For example, voice access supports scenarios such as opening and switching apps, browsing the web, reading and composing emails, and more. Voice access utilizes the latest on-device speech recognition to accurately recognize speech and is supported without an internet connection. When a user calls for voice access, the device's microphone is used. More information about voice access (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2173502).
	
Personalization of hand-drawn and keyboard input. Typing input and handwritten input words are also collected. It is intended to provide users with a custom word list and apply proper character recognition when typing and handwriting on the device to provide typing hints when typing and handwriting.
	
You can disable the Draw & Keyboard Input personalization settings at any time. This will remove any custom word lists stored on your device. If you enable it again, you will need to recreate the custom word list. Learn more about freehand typing & typing personalization in (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=544945)Windows.
	
Sync and backup settings
	
When you sign in to Windows with a Microsoft account, Windows can store your settings, files, and device configuration data on Microsoft's servers. Windows only uses stored settings, files, and device configuration data to facilitate the migration of experiences on another device.
	
You can turn off this feature to prevent Windows from saving settings, files, and configuration data from Windows Settings. You can delete data that you previously backed up to your Microsoft account by visiting the Microsoft account device page (https://account.microsoft.com/devices).
	
Learn more about Windows backup and sync settings (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2172845).
	
Renewal Services
	
Windows update services include Windows Update and Microsoft Update. Windows Update is a service that provides software updates for other supporting software, such as drivers and firmware provided by Windows software and device manufacturers. Microsoft Update is a service that provides updates for other Microsoft software, such as Microsoft 365.
	
Windows Update automatically downloads Windows software updates to your device. If Windows Update is available (recommended), or if Windows notifies you of a restart that requires the update to finish installing, configure Windows Update to install these updates automatically. As described in the "Microsoft Store (https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement#mainwindowsstoremodule)" section of this Privacy Statement, applications available in the Microsoft Store are automatically updated through the Microsoft Store.
	
Web browsers: Microsoft Edge Legacy and Internet Explorer
	
This section applies to legacy versions of Microsoft Edge (version 44 and earlier). For non-legacy versions of Microsoft Edge, see the Microsoft Edge (https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement#mainmsedgemodule)section of the Privacy Statement.
	
Microsoft Edge is the default web browser for Windows. Microsoft's legacy browser, Internet Explorer, is also available for Windows. Whenever you use a web browser to access the Internet, data about your device ("Standard Device Data") is sent to the websites you are visiting and to the online services you are using. Standard device data includes the user's IP address, browser type, language, access time, and referring website address. This data is logged on to the website's web server. What data is logged on and how it is used depends on the privacy policy of the websites you visit and the web services you use. In addition, Microsoft Edge sends a unique browser ID to specific websites so that Microsoft can develop aggregate data that we use to improve browser features and services.
	
In addition, the user's browser usage data, such as history, web form data, temporary Internet files, and cookies, is stored on the user's device, for example. Users can delete this data using Delete browsing history.
	
Microsoft Edge allows you to capture content such as and save it to your device:
		
Web Notes. You can create ink and text annotations on the web pages you visit, and then clip, save, or share them.
		
Active reading. You can create and manage reading lists that contain websites or documents.
		
Hub. Easily manage your reading list, favorites, downloads, and history in one area.
			
Pin a website to the taskbar. You can pin your favorite websites to the Windows taskbar. Because websites can identify web pages that users have pinned, you can provide users with a notification badge to let them know that there is a new item to refer to on the website.
	
Some Microsoft browser information stored on the device is synchronized across devices when the user signs in with their Microsoft account, so they can access data on all browsers that they are signed in to on any device. For example, browsing history and favorites in Internet Explorer, favorites, reading lists, and autofill form entries (such as name, address, and phone number) fall under this information, and may also include data about the extensions you have installed. For example, in Microsoft Edge, when you sync your Reading List across multiple devices, a copy of the content you choose to save to your Reading List will be sent to all synced devices for you to view later. You can disable Internet Explorer sync by going to Start > Settings > Accounts > Sync Settings. (For more information, see the Sync settings (https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement#mainsyncsettingsmodule) section of this privacy statement.) Also, to disable Microsoft Edge browser information syncing, disable the sync option in Microsoft Edge settings.
	
Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer use your search queries and browsing history to provide faster browsing and more relevant search results. These features include:
		
Internet Explorer Search Suggestionsautomatically sends information entered in the browser address bar to the user's default search provider (such as Bing) and provides search recommendations as characters are entered.
	
Microsoft Edge Search Suggestions and Site Suggestions automatically send information entered in the browser address bar to Bing (regardless of whether the user has selected a different default search provider) and provide search suggestions as a character is typed.
	
Users can disable these features at any time. To provide search results, Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer send search queries, standard device information, and location information (if location is enabled) to your default search provider when you use the app. If Bing is your default search provider, Microsoft will use this data as described in the Bing (https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement#mainbingmodule) section of this Privacy Statement.
	
AI features in Windows
	
Click to Run
	
Run with a click can work with Recall or as a standalone feature. Once launched, you can use the Click to Run feature to capture and analyze screenshots, identify the presence of text or images, and take appropriate action on each. For example, Click to Run offers options to edit screenshot images and correct or rewrite captured text. While click-to-run doesn't allow you to identify the content of the text or image identified within the screenshot, you can use local AI or other tools to modify the content as needed. Unless you make an explicit choice, all data remains on your local device. For example, you can send an image to Bing to do a search, ask a click-to-run to create a summary of the user's selected text (in this case, it will be sent to Microsoft's Azure AI cloud service), or use other local AI or other tools to correct a screenshot of a click-to-send submission.
	
In Run with a click, you can also use Microphone to search for text in the captured screenshot. Click the Microphone button to hear what is being spoken, it is entered in the search box, and all search results are highlighted. The audio captured by the microphone is not transmitted to the device.
	
Windows Recall
	
Recall is a Windows feature only available on Copilot+ PCs that allows users to search for what they see on their device using text or visual cues they remember. To use Recall, users must opt-in to save snapshots to their Copilot+ PC, which is an image containing everything displayed on the screen. The snapshot contains relevant metadata, such as the app's name and timestamp. All data is stored locally on the device and protected by Windows Hello Sign-in Enhanced Security (ESS). ESS provides more secure biometric sign-in, ensuring that only you have access to your information. Each time you launch Recall, users are prompted to authenticate with a Windows Hello biometric sign-in or PIN before the contents of the snapshot folder are decrypted. Click to do appears above the snapshot of the Recall and helps users get things done faster by allowing them to take action on the content on the screen (image or text). Snapshot analysis is always performed locally on the device, and the actions that can be taken change depending on the type of content detected.
	
You can also use the Copilot+ PC device's microphone as a way to search for text in captured snapshots. Click the Microphone button in the search input box in the Recall window to hear what is being spoken and enter it into the search box. The microphone is used until you pause speech recognition input, at which point it turns off until you explicitly press the Microphone button again. All matching points in the search results will be highlighted. The audio captured by the microphone is not transmitted to the device.
	
Data captured by Recall (for example, personal data such as snapshots, metadata, processing results, and user queries) is stored on the device of the account you are signed in to on your Copilot+ PC and is not sent externally from the device unless you take certain actions. This could be for example if you copy and paste a snapshot into another app, or if you choose to include a snapshot when you submit feedback through the Windows Feedback Hub. The only way you can share Recall content with someone is if the user takes an explicit action on the device.
	
You can control content (such as snapshots, metadata, search queries, and history) by pausing or deleting snapshots, filtering content, and using the privacy mode of supported browsers. Learn more about privacy and controlling your Recall experience here (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/privacy-and-control-over-your-recall-experience-d404f672-7647-41e5-886c-a3c59680af15).
	
In addition to the Recall search feature, Recall also has a timeline, in which snapshots are organized in chronological order and visualized with a horizontal scrollbar. You can use this scroll bar to search for and utilize past activity on your PC. In addition to the features available in the timeline, you can delete individual snapshots from this view, all snapshots containing a specific website's domain (e.g., all snapshots of www.bing.com), and specific app snapshots collectively.
	
Recall also has a sensitive content filter that is enabled by default, which prevents sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers, government-issued ID numbers, etc.) from being stored. Users can turn off this filter from Windows settings if they wish.
	
Many Microsoft applications are built into Windows, and others can be purchased in the Microsoft Store. Windows apps include:
	
Maps app. Maps apps provide location-based services and utilize Bing services to process user searches within the Maps app. If the Maps app has allowed you to access your location and location-based services are enabled in Windows, Bing services will collect the text you type after the "@" key to show location-based suggestions when you start a search using the "@" key in a supported text box in the Windows app. For more information about your Bing experience, see the Bing (https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement#mainbingmodule) section of this privacy statement. When the Maps app accesses your location, Microsoft collects anonymized location information from your device to improve Microsoft services, even when you're not using Maps. You can disable the Maps application from accessing your location by disabling location services or disabling access to location services for the Maps application.
	
Users can record their favorite places, the latest map searches in the Maps application. Your favorite places and search history will be added to your search suggestions. By giving the Maps app access to your camera, you can capture where the photo was taken. For example, if you take a picture of a car, you can see where the car is parked. You can also share your location with other people in your contacts. If you're signed in with a Microsoft account, your favorite locations, search history, and some app settings are synced to and from other devices and services. For more information, see the Sync and back up settings (https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement#mainsyncsettingsmodule) section of this privacy statement.
	
Camera app. When you allow the camera application to use your location, your location is recorded in the photos and videos you take on your device. Detailed data such as camera model and date of photo and video capture are also recorded in photos and videos. When you share a photo or video, the recorded data is available to the person you share it with and the service. If you do, you can disable the camera application from accessing your location at any time by disabling all access to location services in the device's settings menu, or by disabling access to location services for the camera application.
	
When you open the Camera app, it displays a rectangle of the area of the image that may be used for image enhancement on the selected camera. The camera app doesn't retain any image enhancement data. You can change the camera's access settings at any time in the Windows settings menu. The camera app uses a variety of device features, including location, camera, microphone, video, and image library. For more information, visit the Microsoft Store (https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9wzdncrfjbbg).
	
Photos app. There are two versions of the Photos app available. The updated Photos app includes features such as iCloud integration and local and cloud folder views. The previous legacy version of the Photos app includes features such as a video editor, People tab, and albums. If the "Overview" section of the Photos app settings indicates that the app is an "updated" Photos app, you are using the updated Photos app. In some cases, both the updated Photos app and the legacy version of Photos may be downloaded on the user's device.
	
The updated Photos app helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. For example, the Photos app offers different ways to group photos and videos by name, date taken, or date modified. You can also group them into folders and other cloud services where those files are stored, such as stored locally on your device or synced from OneDrive, iCloud to your device. The app can also move, copy, or upload files to different locations on your computer or on OneDrive. The All Photos tab shows photos and videos that have been stored or synced locally, depending on the date they were taken. The Favorites tab allows you to view photos and videos that you have previously added to your favorites. The Folders tab allows you to view photos and videos by storage location. There is also a tab where you can view photos and videos from any available cloud services that you have synced to your device, such as OneDrive or other third-party services.
	
The Photo Legacy app also helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. However, if you are using the classic Photos app, you may see other features that are not available in the new version of the Photos app, such as collections, albums, video editors, and person settings. The Collections tab displays photos and videos according to the date they were taken. The Albums tab helps you organize your photos and videos by location and general tags. The video editor allows you to edit, create, and share videos.
	
You can enable the People setting on the Settings page of the Photos Legacy app and on the People tab of the app. When enabled, the Photo Legacy app uses face grouping technology to organize your photos and videos into groups. The grouping feature detects faces in photos and videos and identifies whether they are visually similar to faces in other photos or videos in your local photo gallery. You can choose to associate a face group with your contacts in the People app.
	
When enabled in the Photos Legacy app, groupings are stored on your device as long as you choose to group or keep photos and videos. If the People setting is turned on, you'll be prompted to allow the Photo Legacy app to continue allowing face grouping after you haven't worked with it for three years. You can turn the People setting on or off at any time by going to the Settings page in the Photos Legacy app. Turning off this feature will remove the face grouping data from the classic app for Photos, but not your photos and videos. Details of traditional apps and face grouping in photos (https://support.microsoft.com/help/4468245/group-photos-by-faces).
	
If you choose to share photos and videos using the Photos app or the classic Photos app, the user or service you share the photo or video with will have access to the embedded data (such as location, camera model, and date).
	
People application. You can use the People application to view all your contacts in one place and communicate with your contacts. When you add an account to the People app, the contacts in the account are automatically added to the People app. You can add other accounts, such as social networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) or email accounts, to the People application. When you add an account, you will see the data that you want to import or sync from a specific service to the People application. At this time, the user can select the data they want to add. Other applications that you install also sync data with the People app, for example, by adding information to existing contacts. When you view a contact in the People app, you get information about your recent interactions with your contacts, such as emails and calendar events from apps that the People app uses to sync data from. From the People app, you can delete your account at any time.
	
Outlook mail/calendar app. The Mail and Calendar apps allow you to connect all your email, calendars, and files, including information from third-party email and file storage providers, in one place. The app provides location-based services, such as calendar weather information, but you can disable the app's use of your location. When you add an account to the Mail & Calendar app, the email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings in that account are automatically synced with your device and Microsoft servers. You can delete your account at any time, and you can change the data you sync with your account at any time. To configure your account, you need to enter your account credentials (such as username and password) in the app. The credentials entered are then sent over the internet to the third-party provider's servers. The app will first attempt to configure your account using a secure connection (SSL), but if your email provider doesn't support SSL, it will send this information unencrypted. If you're adding an account provided by an organization, such as a company or school, the owner of your organization's domain may implement certain policies and controls (for example, requiring multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe device data), which may affect how you use the app. This app uses device features like location, camera, and more. For more information, visit the Microsoft Store (https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9wzdncrfhvqm).
	
Windows Operator Messages (formerly Microsoft Messaging) app. The Windows Operator Messages app receives and displays SMS texts from your carrier related to your account for your data plan on your PC or device, such as billing or data limits. These messages are stored locally on your device. From your device, you can also access, view, and delete these messages. This app uses device features such as contacts. For more information, visit the Microsoft Store on Windows.
	
The Clock app is a hub for time management and focuses on Windows. When users sign in with their Microsoft account, they can enable Microsoft To Do, a connected experience in the cloud. When a user turns on a focus session, the session data is stored locally and can be cleared by going to the watch's settings page. Additionally, focus sessions support connecting to Spotify accounts, allowing users to listen to ambient audio to help them focus. For more information, see the Microsoft Store (https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9wzdncrfj3pr).
	
Microsoft Journal is a Windows application designed specifically for devices that can use touch and pen capabilities, such as tablets and 2-in-1 devices. Provide users with a free-form personal note-taking experience. The app leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to better recognize handwriting that processes data locally on the device. Once connected to Microsoft 365 (subscription required), users can seamlessly access their M365 calendar and contacts within the app. All user-created content is automatically saved to the default storage location in the document library for future reference. The journal gives you access to your photo library, your device's camera, and microphone, and you can add them to your book. Learn more about the Journal app here (https://support.microsoft.com/topic/microsoft-journal-help-and-learning-3605c04e-0fc6-40d5-b3fd-95a5cc365bc2) or visit the Microsoft Store (https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n318r854rhh).

PC Manager blocks pop-ups based on ad-blocking rules and the pop-up windows selected by the user using custom blocking. If you agree to join the "Microsoft PC Manager Pop-up Plan" and block pop-up windows with custom blocks, you can take a screenshot of the pop-up and then send it to Microsoft to help optimize the pop-up management feature in Microsoft PC Manager. Microsoft doesn't collect any information other than screenshots, Windows titles, and Windows classes. Sent screenshots are only kept for a short time and are deleted periodically. You can manage your pop-up plan preferences at any time using the PC Manager settings. The PC Manager feedback feature may also process personal data if you include it in the feedback you provide to Microsoft. User feedback is periodically deleted after processing. For more information, see the Microsoft Store (https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pm860492szd).
	 
The Snipping Tool is a handy utility in Windows that uses your microphone and image library to capture and save screenshots and screen recordings. The Snipping Tool includes a text action feature that uses built-in optical character recognition (OCR) support. You can use OCR to select and copy text directly from an image. You can also use the text action feature to edit sensitive information from the captured text. When you use the clipboard to copy an integrated item from the Snipping Tool, it is also copied to the clipboard. By enabling clipboard history across devices, you can seamlessly use your copied content across different devices. Users can use Windows settings to manage clipboard and snipping preferences. For more information, see the Microsoft Store (https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9mz95kl8mr0l).
	 
The Windows Sound Recorder app is a versatile tool designed to capture audio from the microphone in various scenarios.

To provide an even better experience, such as the language you want to display, Clipchamp collects inaccurate locations. Users can access Clipchamp using their personal or family Microsoft account from the Clipchamp app for Windows 10, or Windows 11, and from https://app.clipchamp.com (https://app.clipchamp.com/) in Edge or Chrome browsers.
	
Media Player is the default built-in player for multimedia (audio and video) files. When you choose to open a multimedia file, Media Player reads its contents. When you open Media Player, it reads the contents of your music and video library folders and creates your own music library and video library pages within Media Player to help you organize, view, and play multimedia content.
	
To enrich the experience when playing music, Media Player attempts to automatically display artist and album art for the content you play and for content in your Music Library. To provide this information, Media Player sends a request for information to Microsoft, including standard device data such as IP address, device software version, region and language settings, and content identifiers. If you want, you can disable this feature on the app's settings page.
	
Film and television. With Movies & TV from Microsoft, you can rent or buy movies and TV episodes and play them on your device.
	
To make it easier to find content that interests you, Movies & TV collects data about the movies and TV shows that users watch, such as watch time and ratings given by users.
	
Movies & TV also allows you to view and play local video files stored on your PC. To do this, you need to access the video library on your device.
	
Windows Media Player Classic. Windows Media Player legacy allows you to import media content, such as video, audio, and photo files, and you can play CDs and other digital content (such as video and audio files), rip CDs, and manage your media library. To provide users with a rich experience when playing content, Windows Media Player Legacy displays relevant media information, such as album titles, song titles, album art, artists, and composers. Windows Media Player Legacy sends a request to Microsoft that includes standard computer information, media content identifiers, and media information already stored in the Windows Media Player Legacy library, including information that you have entered or edited yourself, to expand the media information. This information allows Microsoft to recognize the track and return additional information that is available.
	
Windows Media Player Legacy also allows you to play content that has already been streamed over a network. In the previous version of Windows Media Player, you need to communicate with a streaming media server to provide this service. These servers are typically operated by content providers other than Microsoft. Windows Media Player Legacy sends logs to streaming media servers and other web servers when requested by the streaming media server while streaming media is playing. The logs include details such as connection time, IP address, operating system version, Windows Media Player legacy version, Player identification number (Player ID), date, and protocol. To protect user privacy, Windows Media Player legacy versions send a different Player ID for each session by default.

Windows Hello provides instant access to a user's device through biometric authentication. If you have Windows Hello enabled, Windows Hello uses your face, fingerprint, and iris to identify you based on your characteristics, which are extracted from images and stored as templates on your device. However, it does not store images of the user's actual face, fingerprints, or iris. The biometric data used to sign in remains on the device. Your biometric data remains on your device until you delete it. However, after Windows Hello has been inactive for a period of time, you'll be prompted to confirm that you want to continue saving your biometric data. Biometric data can be cleared in the settings. For more information, see Windows Hello (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=617027).

Windows Search allows you to search for items and websites that you own from a single location.

The Microsoft Store is an online service that allows you to browse, download, buy, rate, and review applications and other digital content. You can access it on your PC, Xbox console, and the Xbox app. Offers from the Microsoft Store include:

Apps and content for Windows devices like phones, PCs, and tablets.

Games, subscriptions, and other apps for 

Xbox consoles and other devices.

Products and apps for Microsoft 365, SharePoint, Exchange, Access, and Project (2013 versions and later).

We collect data about your access to and usage of the Microsoft Store, the products you view, purchase, or install, the preferences you use to view apps in the Store, the ratings, reviews, and issues you submit. The user's Microsoft account is associated with ratings and reviews. When you complete a review, the user's Microsoft account name and image are published on the review. The Store uses the regions configured by your device to display relevant eligible content and merchandising plans. The Microsoft Store uses device identifiers to manage product rights associated with a specific device.

Microsoft Store app permissions. Many apps that you install from the Microsoft Store are designed to take advantage of the capabilities of specific hardware and software on your device. When an application uses certain hardware and software features, the application or related services may access your data. For example, a photo editing application accesses the user's device's camera. This allows users to take new photos or access photos and videos stored on their devices for editing. Restaurant Guide uses the user's location to recommend nearby restaurants. Information about the app's features can be found on the application's product description page in the Microsoft Store. Many features used in Microsoft Store apps can be toggled on or off in your device's privacy settings. Windows often allows you to choose which apps can use it for each specific feature. Start > Settings > Privacy or Privacy & Security , select a feature (such as Calendar), and then select the app permissions you want to turn on or off. The list of hardware and software features that apps can use in Windows privacy settings doesn't show "classic Windows" applications, but they aren't affected by this setting.

Application updates. Unless you have disabled automatic app updates in the relevant Microsoft Store settings, or if you get an app provided and updated by the app developer, the Microsoft Store automatically checks for app updates, downloads, installs, and ensures that the latest version is installed. Updated applications may use different Windows hardware and software than previous versions, which may allow these hardware and other devices to access different data on your device. When an updated application accesses certain features, such as location, the user is asked for consent. You can also view the Microsoft Store product description page to see the hardware and software features your app uses.

The use by each application of the data collected by these features is subject to the app developer's privacy policy. If an application that is available for purchase in the Microsoft Store collects and uses users' personal information, the application developer is required to publish a privacy policy. Links to these policies can be found on the App Product Description page in the Microsoft Store.
Sideload application and developer mode. Developer features, such as setting up "Developer Mode", are used for development purposes only. When developer features are enabled, the user's device becomes unstable or unusable, exposing the user to security risks. When you download or purchase an application from a source other than the Microsoft Store, known as "sideloading" an application, your device and personal information are affected by an attack or unintended use of the application. If you use a sideload app or have developer features enabled, Windows policies, notices, permissions, and other features designed to protect user privacy when accessing your app's user data may not work as described in this Statement.
	
Microsoft Start
Microsoft Start, formerly known as MSN or Microsoft News, is a content service that includes news, weather, sports, and finance. The Microsoft Start app is available on multiple platforms, including iOS and Android. The Microsoft Start service is also included in the Microsoft Edge browser and other Microsoft services.

When you install the Microsoft Start app, the MSN Weather app, or the Microsoft News app, we collect information about your device, such as whether the app was installed correctly, the date it was installed, the app version, and other operating systems and browsers. This information is collected periodically and used to identify performance issues related to the number of users of the application and different versions of the application and OS, as well as browsers. When you use the Weather App, Microsoft uses your location to provide you with relevant weather content.

Microsoft also collects data about how users interact with Microsoft Start content, such as how often they use it and what content they watch, in order to provide you with relevant content. Some parts of Microsoft Start offer an enhanced experience when a user signs in with a Microsoft account. For example, it allows users to customize their interests and favorites. We use your location to provide you with relevant content, such as local weather and news. Users can manage personalization features through Microsoft Start and Bing settings, as well as through settings for other Microsoft services, including Microsoft Start services. We also use the data we collect to provide you with ads that may be of interest to you. You can opt out of interest-based advertising through the advertising link within the Microsoft Start service, or by visiting Microsoft's opt-out page (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759).

Previous versions of MSN Money allow users to access their personal financial information from third-party financial institutions. MSN Money only displays this information and does not store it on our servers. The login credentials used to access user financial information from third-party financial institutions are encrypted on the device and are not sent to Microsoft. These financial institutions and other third-party services that you access through MSN are subject to their own terms and privacy policies.
	
	
Silverlight
Microsoft Silverlight is software that helps users access and enjoy rich content on the web. Silverlight allows websites and services to store data on the user's device. Other Silverlight features include connecting to Microsoft for updates or to Microsoft or third-party servers for playback on protected digital content.

Silverlight configuration tools. The Silverlight Configuration Tool provides choices for these features. To access the Silverlight configuration tool, right-click on the content that Silverlight is currently displaying, and select Silverlight. You can also run the Silverlight configuration tool directly. For example, on Windows, you can search for "Microsoft Silverlight" to access the tool.

Silverlight application storage. Silverlight-based applications store data files locally on a user's computer for a variety of purposes. For example, saving customized settings, large files with graphical features (such as games, maps, images, etc.) and saving content created in specific applications. The Silverlight configuration tool allows you to disable or configure the storage of your application.

Updates for Silverlight. Silverlight regularly checks Microsoft's servers for updates and provides users with the latest features and improvements. A small file containing information about the latest Silverlight version is downloaded to the user's computer and compared to the current installed version. If a new version is available, it will be downloaded and installed on your computer. The Silverlight configuration tool allows you to disable or configure the storage of your application.

Digital rights management. Silverlight uses Microsoft Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology to protect the rights of content owners. When you access DRM-protected content (such as music or video) in Silverlight, the content requests media usage rights from an Internet rights server. To provide a seamless playback experience, there is no instruction to the user before Silverlight sends a request to the rights server. When requesting media usage rights, Silverlight provides the rights server with the ID of the DRM-protected content file and basic data about the device. This includes data about the DRM content on the device, such as device confirmation, security levels, and unique identifiers.

DRM updates. When accessing DRM-protected content, you may need to update the DRM components on your device or to Silverlight. If a user attempts to play DRM updated content, Silverlight sends a request for basic data about the device to Microsoft servers. This includes information about the DRM content on the device, such as device checks, security levels, and troubleshooting data and unique identifiers. Microsoft servers use this identifier to send an update for the device's unique DRM, and Silverlight installs this sent update. In the Playbacktab of the Silverlight configuration tool, you can disable or configure DRM component updates.
